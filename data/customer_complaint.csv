All I asked was that the credit bureaus show me how they verified this debt and what XXXX XXXX sent them as proof of my debt other than a bill that could be fabricated.

Ive always considered it a priority to make all my payments on time. Unfortunately, I fell short of my own standards earlier this year, and I was over a month late in XX/XX/2018 ( payment reported as 30-59 days late ). Also, I had been carrying a sizable balance for several months but as I am writing to you now, I am in the process of paying of the balances on my Upstart account. their records will show that I had never been late with a payment until this unfortunate oversight. 

The reason for me to be off the schedule to make the payments is that I got married in XX/XX/2018 ( Proof of Marriage ). As a result, I travelled out for my honeymoon for a few days, having expected to be back in time to take care of my payments. Unfortunately, During the few days honeymoon, my wife fell very Ill and could not come back as planned. I wish all was well in our Honeymoon and had come back in time but now its too late for me to go back in time and fix the situation. This was not entirely my fault as I was not around to make payment. Were it not for this set back, I could have maintained my perfect record. I can assure you it wont happen again going forward. 

The reason for writing this letter is that Im planning to apply for a mortgage loan, and its come to my attention that the missed payment on my record could hurt my ability to qualify. I truly believe that it doesnt reflect my creditworthiness and commitment to repaying my debts. 

As a long-time customer in good standing, it would help me immensely if you could give me a second chance and make a goodwill adjustment to remove the late payment from my file that was reported in XX/XX/2018.

03/13/2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX I received a two notices in the mail from BBVA Compass bank about two transactions of "" Failed Scheduled Transactions ''. The notices are dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. This triggered me to contact BBVA to find out about these transactions. These transactions turned out to be fraudulent. the information I was able to gathered turned out to be the tip of the iceberg. I was advised several ATM and Wire transactions totaling $ XXXXhad been completed over 30 transactions from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

The next day my wife and I arrived at the local BBVA branch to make a claim for the unauthorized wire and ATM transactions. At that time the local banker advised the profile on my account had been changed. My contact telephone number had been changed, on-line banking was added to may account ( note : I had cancelled the on-line account when my parents passed away. The BBVA records will support there has not been an on-line account since XX/XX/XXXX ). In addition, PIN numbers had been changed/updated or added without my knowledge or consent. I have only one ATM card. 

It became clear during my visit to the local branch someone had impersonanted my wife and the changes were complete. 

Based these facts I believe XXXX has a serious breach in there security and the responsibility of securing my funds or to vet any person who attempts to make the changes described above without the person "" personally '' going to the bank. 

Let me repeat. Any changes made by BBVA was irresponsible, was not properly vetted and without my consent. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the personal bank assisted to report all Unauthorized phone transactions ( ATM and Wire ) we completed all necessary forms ( so I thought ) and Case Numbers for both the Wire and ATM Dispute claims were completed. I was advised I would need to return to the back to complete and notarize Affidavits for the Wire transfers. This was completed on XX/XX/XXXX. The affidavits were emailed to the fraud department before I left the bank on the 7th. 

This is were the nightmare begins. Since that day BBVA personnel had never been upfront and honest when asked the question ... '' can you advise how, when and what occurred on or about XX/XX/XXXX when a person who claimed to be my spouse either called in to make the changes above. '' No response. I requested copies of any telephone recording on the day in question involving my account. No reply. Denied. 

The second question ... "" can you advise what your investigation will entail and when will it be completed. '' I have been provided a dozen different responses to this question. 

I have been lied to, had the phone hung up on me and been treated, not as a customer, or a victim, but as the accused. 

I have asked, if you are satisfied I am a victim, then why has my money not been returned to me and you seek your funds from the bank receiving the wire transfer ( XXXX XXXX  ) or from the entities who received funds from ATM transactions. The replies come from inexperienced personnel in The Who read from scripts and have to reach outside to "" back offices '' for updates. Not once has a XXXX investigator contacted me to advise on XXXX part of their progress. 

I submitted a written complaint on XX/XX/XXXX to the president of the BBVA XXXX XXXX. I have never received a call or written acknowledgement from anyone! Also, we hand delivered a copy of this home office complaint to the local BBVA Branch in XXXX, CA. 

But it gets better. After two weeks on constant calling on my part. I was advised Provisional deposits would be made on XX/XX/XXXX for the unauthorized ATM withdrawals. Form letters dated XX/XX/XXXX were finally received indicating credits for each transaction was provided. The form letter requested a return of a Written Statement of Unauthorized Debit. The form did not include when the form should be returned. When I contacted BBVA on XX/XX/XXXX to question the amounts noted on the cover letter I was advised I needed to return the form by XX/XX/XXXX or the Provisional deposits added to my account would be removed. Again NO ONE advised when I met with the personal banker on XX/XX/XXXX or on any of the numerous calls that this form needed to be completed and why then if the form was needed would my account be created without first returning a form BBVA Compass so desperately needed? 

Well I had to create a separate Word document with the dates of all the transactions and amounts, because the form letter did not provide enough space to list all of the transactions. The word document, a copy of the XX/XX/XXXX form letter and its attachments were mailed on XX/XX/XXXX in the self-addressed envelope provided by BBVA. I wanted to scan and email the information, but when I contacted the number on the form letter, BBVA was closed on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX and I need to call during normal business hours XXXX XXXX. 

Thinking I had completed with everything BBVA required, I was shocked to received another form letter dated XX/XX/XXXX denying my claim and to advise ALL of the Unauthoized ATM I had claimed transactions were now considered Authorized based on their investigation and all provisional deposits would be removed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called the dispute department the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to the representative and a supervisor and was told the Written Statement of Unauthorized Debit had not been received and I would have to start new new dispute and a new claim!!!!! BBVA would not open the same claim. In fact, and this is odd since BBVA is not open on Saturday the claim was closed on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX.

03/13/2019,Debt collection,I do not know,False statements or representation,"Impersonated attorney, law enforcement, or government official","This complaint is about the business practices of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX XXXX, California and its staff who lie repeatedly and appear to be running a total scam. Trying to collect debts and demanding you pay them or they will threaten to sue you, put a lien on your house, they admitted to calling relatives we don't speak to -- -even though they had our number and we have lived in the same place for 8 years. They lie when they call and refuse to identify themselves, they demand your full name and SSN and Birthdate and when you don't give it they begin threatening you repeatedly. If you tell them you don't know what the debt is, they claim you are a liar and you are not allowed to get a word in to the point you have to hang up. If you write them ANY letters, they will claim not to have received them. 

When this company began contacting me they could provide me with XXXX  answers. They act like you are their slave and that they are the only people entitled to any information. They failed to provide me with very basic information like the original account number and name of the company claiming I owed the money. They refused to do any of this, they also have an incorrect last name, this is not the name I use, I will not give these people my SSN and they had the incorrect Birth date, and then changed the birth date to match the correct one illegally. 

I am not paying this debt since I had to do all the work myself -- -I have never had any credit with the business they are claiming which turned out to be some XXXX XXXX I have not been to since XXXX. When I had gone to this place I used an ATM card not credit to pay for my pet to get fixed and that does not cost anywhere near the amount these people are claiming. Also in order to get your pet back, you have to pay the bill and since I still have my pet its obvious I did. I moved not long after I last visited this place, and have since that time used a totally different clinic since XXXX. I have no line of credit at any of these places. 

My husband works for the feds and the constant attacks on XXXX caused our information to be stolen and used by unknown persons locally and not locally numerous times and we retain the statements from XXXX telling us we are victims. They too have recently conducted their investigation and ruled in our favor with regards to this debt. These people can provide me with NO information despite the multiples of times I have asked for it -- -all they send is a piece of paper that has an amount due and threatening comments about suing me, they have also sent me fake court documents and I took these to the court house and they stated they were FAKE. That's not legal, they also call and leave messages calling themselves "" investigators '' that's incorrect as they are debt collectors. Its also not legal to state they are investigators. A few called claiming to be attorneys and told me they could garnish my wages. They send letters demanding you respond 7 days from the date on the headers, and then make sure to mail the letters the day before the last day of response, this way when you receive it -- -its already expired for response. 

The BBB gives these people a "" C '' rating and I can see why. I took a trip to find out where this place was, but it appeared to be operating out of some elderly people 's hospital which didn't make any sense. 

They have called my house and when my daughter or sister answered the phone the man or woman on the other end called them "" XXXX '' and claimed they were me. Calling these people or making any contact at all with them is a lost cause. They have NO information to share with me other than a supposed amount I know with no account number attached to it. Its not the first time some creditor has done this and I am sure it wont be the last since our information as govt workers is never secure. These people did not even begin contacting us until mid XXXX and claimed they had been trying to collect since XXXX ... the last phone call I received was a threatening call about how she was going to see me in court in XXXX, well past the statute of limitations for collection. I have asked for their business License and have gotten no response, I have searched for the names listed in the fake documents only to find said people use false or fake not full names. 

They are constantly playing games. Its getting very old and its obvious they are trying very hard to collect a debt they can not prove I own. No signature card, no correct Birthdate, no SSN, refused to give me the name of the original creditor, I actually had to find this information myself. I called the vet clinic and also went in and they had no record of any such debt from any time period. However, they also claimed they had no control over the bank they used to offer credit to people. They would not give me the name of that bank either. 

Their fake threatening court docs were signed on XX/XX/XXXX and claimed you had 7 days to respond ... the item arrived in the mail box XX/XX/XXXX way passed the 7 days dead line- this is also bad business practice and its the second time they've sent the same letter and did the same exact thing making sure you can not respond to them. It also still does not state the account number for this line of credit, it does not give a start date or an end date for it, and they added all kinds of other false charges to the debt. 

They contacted my husbands mother, a woman he does not have contact with. She is an XXXX and XXXX XXXX, these people shared my information with her, and she called my home and told me about it. My husband is not listed on this debt, so why was his mother who lives in another state contacted? I had not spoken to this woman in 15 years and have no intention of doing so ever again because of some company like this. I do not owe this debt, the very business claiming I owe it stated they had no record of said debt. I was also told by the XXXX XXXX that this debt is passed the statute of limitation for collections according to the dates they give, which change as time goes by. At no time did I ever take responsibility for this debt, nor did I ever state I would make any payments to them, they are so rude over the phone to my family members who live in my house that I will no longer speak to them at all.

Additionally, the representative confirmed on XX/XX/2019 that my account was closed out and my automatic monthly payment removed, as nothing else was owed. I took screen shots of the payments applied, as illustrated on their website. Then I received a letter dated XX/XX/2019 that indicated my pay-off was complete, my mortgage release documents were being processed and will be mailed to the County Clerk and that I should notify my insurance company and county tax authority to begin mailing statements directly to me. Additionally, I received a check dated XX/XX/2019 for my escrow ( taxes and insurance ). Then I arrived home from business & personnel travel on XX/XX/2019 and opened a new statement from Freedom Mortgage indicating I had a balance of {$51000.00}.

My bank told them that no fourth withdrawl of {$50000.00} was initiated by Freedom Mortgage, so Freedom Mortgage decided they would review the recorded authorizations they had on file with me & their service rep ( on XX/XX/2019 ). After reviewing the recording, they FINALLY agreed it was their fault and they will reverse the accrued interest. I told them I agreed that I owed {$50000.00} but no more ( no interest ) and they can pay my second wire transfer payment and any other fees to perform a 'second ' payoff. I requested a formal letter and payoff indicating that the only remaining amount I owe is {$50000.00} with no accrued interest or other fees, including that they will reimburse me for the second {$30.00} wire transfer I now have to pay my bank. Since this discussion on Thursday, XX/XX/2019, the payoff nor a letter has been sent to me to rectify the situation. I also had to place a stop payment with my bank to not pay the mortgage payment set to withdraw on XX/XX/2019, as I found out Freedom Mortgage illegally set up an automatic withdrawl from my bank after they re-instated my account on XX/XX/2019 without even contacting me to tell me they were re-instating it. I have been fully willing to wire the {$50000.00} as a final payoff but want a formal document from them stating it is my final payoff. Supposedly they are still 'working on it ' to resolve this issue ( since XX/XX/XXXX once they finally believed me ), but now I'm worried that I appear in 'default ' on my loan since I put a stop payment to Freedom Mortgage with my bank and worried my credit score will be in jeopardy, when ironically I was the one paying off my mortgage in full. Each day I talk with them, they ask for another day and they have not let me speak to anyone further than a supervisor when I ask to elevate the issue.

03/12/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"Starting in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX payment system ( XXXX ) started to reverse my auto mortgage monthly payments. I was charged late and returned check fees as a result. I contacted their Services group and was told the following : 1. "" The bank accounts I used did not have the correct account number ''. I told them the bank account I used had been set up since the beginning of the loan, about 5 yrs ago and there had never been any problems with money being transferred into Flagstar until now. 
2. "" The bank I used did not have sufficient funds ''. I forwarded my bank 's history record to show there were plenty of funds to pay when the transactions took place. 
3. "" My banks did not send them the money because of "" not authorized '' transactions ''. I had to forwarded my bank 's history ledgers to show my checking accounts had been debited which shows the money had been sent to Flagstar. 

Due to advice from # 1, I changed my bank on XXXX to 2 other banks to continue paying the monthly mortgage. Both had the same issue. So 3 of my banks had same issues. Flagstar kept reversing my payments with the same above excuses. I told them it was my banks it was their system. 
When Flagstar reversed the payments, the funds that my banks sent to them were never returned. My banks says they had sent the money to Flagstar but never received any notifications the money is being returned. In order to credit back the money my banks had to initiate their own investigation and perform a Dispute before my money could be credited back into my account. 

I talked to about 10 services reps and 2 Supervisors. None can help explain why Flagstar keeps reversing the payments. Each time this happens I get charged a Returned check fee. Because no one at Flagstar can resolve the issues and my money was taken from the checking accounts to pay Flagstar but was not returned when they performed a Returned check I decided to payoff my loan. I don't trust Flagstar to manage my loan anymore. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I follow the payoff procedures and obtained the Payoff value from Flagstar. With the payoff, Flagstar confirmed my loan was paid in full and the Deed of XXXX was sent to me with an Escrow refund. When I cashed the Escrow refund check, Flagstar had put a stopped payment on the refund check and told me I still owe them money. If I don't pay then they will rescind the release of the mortgage/trust. 

Because of the many reversed payments performed by Flagstar I feel they still have not returned all my money and that they still owe me money. I can not get anyone from Flagstar to work with me on the accounting for the money. They keep passing me to other people and each time it gets more confusing and more paperwork is required.

03/12/2019,Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"Background : My identity was unknowingly stolen by a previous roommate who lived in the same household sometime around XXXX. 

It just came to my attention that on XX/XX/XXXX the individual set up a 5 year contract with XXXX for a home alarm account with both of our names as the account holders ( maybe for co-sign purposes? ). This location of the residence where this alarm account was opened is on the opposite side of the country. 

The individual made payments for 1 year and 8 months before the account went delinquent. The account then went to collections a little while later, and landed in the hands of the debt collector named Perfection Collection around XX/XX/XXXX. 

When I was contacted by the debt collector, I let them know that I did not set up this account, nor have I ever lived in the state it was setup in, nor on that side of the United States. I let them know that the individual 's name on the account was a previous roommate, and that he must've stolen my identity 15+ years ago. 

They responded to my deny of the account by saying they already talked to the other individual and he said that I stole his information to setup the account, and then implied that they are only looking for repayment, not looking to get me in trouble for setting up the account under his name ; which isn't even true in the first place. 

I continued to get harassing calls for payment. When I asked how to fix the problem, they did not provide any assistance ; their only interest was to get repayment for the account, and did not take into consideration that the account was fraudulently setup in my name. 

I had to make several calls to get info on how to take this off my credit report, because they were not helping. When I finally reached someone, they were hesitant to give me the information about the account, as well as hesitant about telling me steps I need to get it resolved. 

I filed a police report with my local police, and found more information on steps to take from IdentityTheft.gov on my own ; however, when I call them now they no longer answer the phone, nor do they return my voicemails. 

The delinquent account is still on my credit report, and seems as though they are only wanting to work with me if I were to just pay it off this fraudulent account.",Company believes complaint caused principally by actions of third party outside the control or direction of the company,Perfection Collection,CA,,,Consent provided,Web,03/12/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3177508

03/12/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"NOTICE OF ERROR/DISPUTE CHANGE IN FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES DUAL TRACKING VIOLATIONS To Whom This May Concern : I am requesting that theXX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/2019 sale date be cancelled. I have had my documents in review for some time now and still have not received anything in the mail except that Shellpoint is working on it. Along with other requests I have made. As of today, XX/XX/2019 I have NOT had a response back on the review and yet, I still have a Friday, XX/XX/XXXX sale date hanging over my head. I am very concerned that Shellpoint is using this DUAL TRACKING illegal activity in order to deny me at the last minute in order to steal my property by their deceptive, unfair practices. I was told by my single point of contact, XXXX, that because of the Dispute Status and my documents being in review that he was going to place the sale date on hold and I requested it be postponed or cancelled due to the time restrictions. 

If I am denied a modification, I am requesting a breakdown of all information used to come to this conclusion, as I have a right as a homeowner to review and dispute any erroneous choices Shellpoint may have used to come to their conclusions. I say this from my past experience, since the last review Shellpoint conveniently added 3 properties I do not own, and did not take into consideration that I had properties in a Trial Plan that did not reflect yet on mortgage statements which they chose to use instead and ignore this fact. I have since sent in new, updated financials to which I more than qualify for a modification therefore, if denied again, I am requesting the details of how Shellpoint came to their conclusion, as I believe they are stringing me along, violating Dual-Tracking laws in order to keep me at bay until a few days before the XX/XX/XXXX sale date, steal my property and leave me with no recourse. I do not trust this kind of deception and unfair business practice and am protecting myself legally for a lawsuit should Shellpoint decide to continue this course of illegal action. My attorneys have filed a Lis Pendens purposely in response to their previous behavior and we are ready to move forward if need be. 
I am a single woman and a XXXX year old senior citizen trying to take care of myself financially and I feel Shellpoint and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is treating me unfairly, and are being deceptive in their activities and should be held accountable for their actions. How is it that I have qualified for 4 other modifications on my properties yet Shellpoint, through their erroneous review can not seem to give me a modification? Also, Shellpoint mentioned that they sent me a modification in the mail in the past? If so, I have never received it! Obviously, my actions are in order to get a modification so why would I have ignored a modified, lower payment/principal/interest rate loan if provided to me? I am requesting that whatever modification Shellpoint is speaking of that they offered me be sent to me, as I have never received it. Obviously, since Shellpoint is stating they offered me a modification in the past I must have qualified, so I am requesting that this be mailed to me in order to accept it.

That makes no sense to me because technically I haven't lived with the Owner of the home for 10 years in a previous residence. At the end of the day, when I account for the situation the owner of that home eventually stopped sending and therefore I stopped receiving my mail. I moved into an employment program because of possible government involvement that constituted entrapment charges that I wasn't seeing served. After even more accounting into past events that would constitute possible other felony charges that are not being paid any attention at the current time although they've been communicated to federal law enforcement.

Recently, I linked my account to another bank account that I ended up having issues with, and a few payments were returned. I always made a payment when I was alerted to this, and the payments were never more than a few days late. 

In XXXX, they called me to tell me a payment had been returned, and I immediately paid two months worth of payments due. I was told my next payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX. I found out my card was then placed on a 30 day hold due to the returned payments - fine. I spoke to several people on the phone and no one told me it would be an issue in the future. 

Since I didn't have a payment due until XX/XX/XXXX, I didn't think anything of it.

03/11/2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"Hello. 

I've been a customer of Wells Fargo for about five years in DC. 

Recently when I called the automated line they asked me to say my name in order to record it and use it for identification/security purposes. I don't feel comfortable with that because I don't think it's respectful of privacy and I didn't. They put me through to a customer service agent on that call. 

About a month later I called again and this time their automated system would not put me through without me saying my name. This was never asked of me in the past five years. I managed to get through anyway by pressing zero about ten times and made a complaint to them about requiring my name to be said and about trying to get and use my bio-identity without my permission. 

I called them again recently to return the call of their rep who had left me a voicemail. I had deleted the vm by mistake and forgot the caller 's name and this time they required me to say my name before they would look at my account or before they would speak with me. I refused and asked to speak with a supervisor and the supervisor also refused to speak with me without me saying my name. 

She then tried to get me to say my name in a sneaky way, by saying she needs me to say it in order to continue speaking with me and when I asked her if it was for bio-identity purposes she denied it but she would not settle for me spelling my name. She also engaged in other mildly sneaky or disengenous behavior I feel. 

I am going to close my account because this is a dealbreaker at this point but I find it hard to believe that this kind of behavior is legal. 

I would hope that you will prosecute them if it's not legal behavior. Would you please inform me whether what they are doing is legal or not?

The US Dept. of Education Ombudsman group showed that they did not offset my tax but said that PHEAA has the ability to garnished and certified my tax for Treasury Offset ( TOP ).

But the Law requires PHEAA to offset my tax only with a court order and PHEAA does not have the court order.

Some months later, XXXX contacted me and took ownership of their insured 's liability and I erroneously thought that XXXX would pay all medical bills associated with the accident. I found out that the medical debt to North Carolina had gone to collections, thus spoiling what had been my stellar credit score of the years. 

As a new resident of Georgia, I was never able to find any lawyers to help me with any claims either because they did not practice in North Carolina or because my case was not worth their while. ( Moreover the timing of the accident presented any number of other issues piled up to complicate the matter. ) As I mentioned earlier, I had erroneously thought that XXXX would pay the medical bills that I had incurred. I have finally gotten a settlement offer from XXXX only to find that NC law does not permit XXXX to pay the debt incurred in the NC Hospital emergency department. The settlement leaves me with a diminished credit rating, the balance of over {$1000.00} in collection, and the unresolved question as to why the NC Hospital 's Billing Department did not first make a claim to my health insurers I think that this was an error on the part of the NC Hospital. I want to add that I received subsequent medical treatment through XXXX XXXX, for which liens were attached to the settlement and thus these bills will be paid by XXXX.

03/10/2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Problem with paying off the loan,"Hello, I recently came to the conclusion of the scheduled payments of a {$55000.00} auto loan provided by Valley National Bank ( Acct : XXXX ) in XX/XX/2018. Upon receiving the final payoff statement, Valley National Bank incorporated over {$1000.00} of late payments and fees associated with payments which weren't made on the exact due date of the loan over the life of the loan. I purchased my vehicle at a dealership and had I known that the financing bank, Valley National Bank, didn't offer online payments I may have requested another lender ( if possible ), but nonetheless over the course of my loan term I admittedly didn't always submit a wire request from my primary bank in time to have the funds to Valley National by the due date. So upon receiving the final payoff statement from Valley National which included {$55.00} of principal and {$1000.00} of late fees, I simply asked Valley National to provide me with a reconciliation of the {$1000.00} of late fees over the course of five years of payments so I could validate those {$1000.00} of late fees and/or additional interest. After being bounced around various departments at Valley National I was told by a collections XXXX that the statement had to be mailed and couldn't be made available online. As I waited for the mailed copy to arrive, I continued to receive collection calls on the remaining principal balance and outstanding fees ( daily over the course of 2 weeks ). I assured the parties involved that I wasn't declining to pay and would make payment arrangements upon receipt of the mailed materials. Over the next 2 weeks all I received from Valley National in the mail was further notices of the remaining principal balance and requested fees. At this point I called Valley National collections to again ask on the status of the requested reconciliation materials. I was told that the materials request was never made and that another department would have to handle reconciliations. Concerned, I asked to speak to a manager and urged her to please initiate the request for the materials so I could reconcile. I even offered to make a payment at the time for the remaining principal balance while I awaited the reconciliation materials so as to close out the loan without any negative impact upon my credit status. She assured me that no further collection actions would be taken, no late payment report would be made to the credit bureaus and assured me that the materials would be mailed over the next few days. Ten days later, I still had not received the materials in the mail and again called the company, at which point I was able to "" get to a person '' who had working knowledge of the fee reconciliation system. Rather than asking yet again for the reconciliation to be mailed, I just had her verbally read the day count and $ fees associated with the various payments which weren't made on the due date over the course of the loan, at which point I agreed to pay the principal balance and fees in full, fully expecting that I would never receive a reconciliation in the mail. Days later I received the vehicle title in the mail and figured this was closure, however upon application for a refinance of my existing home loan ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I now discover that over the course of this whole ordeal, Valley National reported me as 30 days late two times for the unpaid {$55.00} balance, while all the while I was simply waiting for their reconciliation of late fees on the payoff notice to be provided to me. I contacted Valley National and asked them to please restate the report to the credit bureau given that my delays were related to an ask for a simple reconciliation of late fees over the course of a five year loan. Valley National declined to consider this and says "" what is done is done ''. Is there any remediation that can be taken at this point. This is virtually the only blemish on my credit over a period of 20+ years and is now impacting the cost of my home loan refinancing.

It was by XXXX XXXX. The inquiry was for a XXXX XXXX XXXX account. Supposedly the inquiry was made XX/XX/XXXX. 

I did not apply for this, I do not know what this is. 

Credit Karma provided me with a link to call XXXX XXXX and have this taken off my account. 

I had first called the number provided at XXXX XXXX., XX/XX/XXXX and talked to a representative. He said I didn't have an account, therefore, he didn't have further instruction or ability to help me because there was supposedly nothing to look into. 

He ( XXXX rep ) said I needed to contact Credit Karma, so I sent XXXX  an email to their support on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. Once I found out numerous people have never received replies, I figured I could call XXXX , seeing how that was the bureau that the inquiry was reported under. 

I called XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. 
The representative gave me instructions for how I can get this taken care of, she even provided me a file number : XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

She instructed me to request a form/letter of release to be sent to my address. Which I would then have to send to XXXX 's XXXX. XXXX in XXXX, PA along with my letter of authorization. 

I called XXXX XXXX a second time, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX. I talked to a different representative, and he stated that this inquiry from XXXX XXXX XXXX was not affiliated with XXXX XXXX. It has no relation to XXXX XXXX, and they don't know why it would be on my credit. 

He also stated that Credit Karma has said that this was a common error, and they tell customers to call XXXX XXXX. He could not send me a letter of release because according to him, if I don't have an account with them then there is nothing to release. 

So then why would this be reporting on my credit report stating to be coming DIRECTLY from XXXX XXXX? It makes no sense. 

Therefore, sticking me into a vicious cycle of contacting whoever the last person told me to contact. 

After various short phone calls, I have no patience to wait months before realizing Credit Karma will never respond to me, and if they did, they would just tell me to contact XXXX XXXX  and the cycle continues. 

I did independent research and found someone who had that exact same problem as me, and this was the method he said worked for him. 

I need to file a complaint with XXXX XXXX, to take that report off of my account because that's exactly what they did for the man who shared this method to the internet. 

I need to file a complaint with Credit Karma. 

And I need to file a complaint with XXXX.

A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue. 

I notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s. 

You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. 

I intend to follow through with the suit if I do not hear back from you within 15 days.

We took out a loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Due to a financial hardship in the XXXX of XXXX, we fell behind in our scheduled monthly payments. While in default an Assignment of Deed of Trust was executed on XX/XX/XXXX that purportedly granted all beneficial interest in the debt to XXXX , XXXX . as Trustee for a Trust. At the time this assignment was executed, the debt was contractually due for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. While still in default and due for the XX/XX/XXXX payment, the debt was purportedly transferred or assigned again to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as Trustee of a Trust. At that time we had no knowledge of these transfers. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a letter from SLS informing us that the servicing of our debt obligation was being transferred to them effective XX/XX/XXXX. At the time SLS purportedly acquired the mortgage servicing the debt was contractually due for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. Over the past year, we have learned that pursuant to the FDCPA and the Rosenthal Act, SLS and XXXX as Trustee are "" debt collectors '' and not "" creditors ''. They are threatening and attempting to proceed with a nonjudicial action to dispossess us from our home without the legal right or authority to do so in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1692f ( 6 ) and California Civil Code 1788.17.  Despite numerous letters to them, they have failed to validate the debt and have failed to provide us with any documentation to demonstrate they have the legal ability to attempt to collect the debt, collect the debt, or enforce the power of sale contained in the deed of trust. Although we have taken legal action against them, they have not stopped their collection and enforcement activities. We are filing this Complaint to make the CFPB aware of their wrongful and illegal actions. The California Supreme Court has confirmed that a borrower is not entitled to pay an entity that is without the legal right and authority to collect and is enforce. In California only a creditor, or an agent of the creditor, may attempt to collect a debt or collect a debt and/or initiate and complete a foreclosure action. Based on information and belief, we believe SLS and XXXX are not creditors nor are they representatives of our true creditors. Falsely representing that the foreclosure documents are legal process is prohibited and misleading and is in violation of California Civil Code 1788.16. SLS and XXXX are engaging in acts that are causing substantial harm not only to us but to California consumers and taxpayers. They are continually attempting to collect a debt that is not due or owed to them. Immediate action must be taken to stop them from engaging in unfair competition. Their conduct is unlawful, unfair and deceptive. They are blatantly disregarding the FDCPA and the Rosenthal Act among other federal and state laws they are mandated to abide by.

This was done knowingly during my protected dispute period., as I was trying to get documentation to resolve the issue. Here are the facts : 1 ) I received a bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, P.O. Box XXXX, XXXX, PA XXXX for {$250.00} for services rendered for an in-network procedure completed in XX/XX/XXXX. 
2 ) I called them to request more documentation as I should not have had a balance after my co-pay, as my deductible was met. They said they had no records and to contact XXXX at XXXX XXXX  At XXXX. XXXX said he could not help as he had no records as the billing company was sold. 
2 ) I then disputed the debt in writing within 14 days of receipt of the bill requesting further documentation. I received none. ( I have written to all parties every 30-days to support my obligation under the law. ) 3 ) I called XXXX XXXX  my health insurance carrier and they told XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to put collections on hold, because it was in the process of being paid by the carrier. XXXX XXXX XXXX ignored this and referred the alleged debt to Associated Credit Services , Inc., P.O. Box XXXX, XXXX, MA XXXX. I immediately sent a written dispute which is included. 
4 ) Along with that dispute I included a check for {$26.00} as a good faith payment only toward any balance documented in the meantime. This was done to show good faith to prevent the matter from going into collections. 
5 ) They cashed my check and did not respond in writing or by phone as requested. 
6 ) Today, I called XXXX and spoke with XXXX who reported that I was mistakenly balance-billed and never owed anything other than the co-pay I made at the time of service. 
7 ) XXXX can be contacted at XXXX option # 2, referencing interaction number XXXX and she could document that there never was a debt. I explained this to all parties and provided her contact information. It was ignored and not pursued. 
8 ) Today XX/XX/XXXX, I called Associated Credit Services , Inc. and reached XXXX XXXX who reported the could not remove the charge-off collection from any of the credit bureaus. I asked why they pursued it during my dispute period within which I had disputed it in writing. He said they never received a letter which is false, as they cashed my check. 
9 ) The false entry to the credit bureaus has caused me damage because they were illegally made during the protected dispute period, violating my federal rights. My credit score dropped XXXX points 10 ) This had an effect on interest rates on current debts and constricted my access to credit based on my previously XXXX score.

I contacted Tower Loan LLC, and asked them to take action to get this inquiry removed from their records and to erase any record of the inquiry with all credit reporting agencies. They assured me they would comply with my request and take whatever steps necessary to resolve the issue, but I wanted to contact you as well, just to make sure this gets done.

Please investigate these inquiries at your earliest possible convenience, as I am going to be applying for a home mortgage in the near future.

Not only did they NEVER attempt to send me validation until I finally had to complain to the CFPB, but under the FDCPA Section 807 ( 8 ) they are in violation ( {$1000.00} fine ) as they did NOT notify the credit bureaus that these accounts were disputed. I pulled a credit report on XX/XX/2019 ( over a month since they received my validation letter ) and there are absolutely no notes from the creditor showing that these accounts were under dispute. I've attached that report to this complaint showing the dates, and the notes on the collection account.

Heres the problem, i originally pulled all 3 of my reports but i never received one from equifax, i tried calling into equifax to ask why i never received a credit report but nobody wanted to help me, like AT ALL!!

I received a letter from equifax in XXXX saying "" as you requested we successfully placed a fraud alert on equifax credit report. This alert will remain on your equifax credit report for one year ''. The letter then goes into how the frraud alert will be passed onto XXXX  and XXXX  and lists some contact information for equifax. Your probably already beginning to see the problems. Do i have a credit report with equifax or not? Id like an answer to that. If i do have a credit report then why did i have to goe through all of the personal document XXXX on the phone? please keep in mind, that doesnt go over well since someone probably stole my identity and someone from from equifax is asking ( more like demanding, Your welcome to listen to the recorded phone calls, i swear im not lieing! ) for photocopys of my personal documents for apparently no reason at all. I wonder how my lawyer would look at that. You cant blame me for saying that, Seriously, do you except me to say to that? Why did i need to send stuff in like AT ALL since i apparently have a credit report? And if i did then were is the original report that was Supposed to be mailed to me run off to? if i dont have a credit report then why did i receive a letter saying i did have one? If i dont have one then whos credit report did the freeze get placed on? Did equifax XXXX something up and label me as someone else, does someone else have my information? Even if equifax isn't at fault for that, is that the person that stole my identity and equifax did nothing about it even with a credit freeze in place? Imagine how well that would go over in court if that's true!

Btw, if i do or dont have a report is a different issue, The people on the phone have so far been stubborn with helping me so how do i unfreeze the report when ready because that seems like a bit of a problem? You probably got my point by now. Equifax just keeps digging a bigger hole for themselves here and im getting tired of having to try to make sense of equifaxes pointless XXXX. For once someone at equifax should FINALLY do their job. Im at a loss for words here so ill wrap this up. If equifax doesnt figure this out, at least partly then ill see equifax in court. i dont want to go that way but with the way equifax has treated me so far, i dont think id have another choice.

This was NOT what they said they would do via a phone call with XXXX at phone number XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX our time. For that phone call, he had been on hold two different times at about XXXX minutes each time. 
XXXX and XXXX resolved our complaint which we had registered the evening before with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The final result was acceptable to both parties - PHH was to take out a {$400.00} mortgage payment on XX/XX/XXXX to be applied to the XX/XX/XXXX payment and take out another payment on XX/XX/XXXX, our regularly scheduled time. They would apply the {$400.00} as though it had been paid on XX/XX/XXXX, with no added fees or interest. and all would be as it should have been had they taken out the XX/XX/XXXX payment on time. PHH should just do what it says it will do when we talk to them. They seem to say one thing and then send a letter with the opposite information. 
I had talked to someone on XX/XX/XXXX about this very issue and they had promised they would take out the {$400.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX, just like XXXX had always done. Then instead of using our {$1000.00} extra payment for interest via a check - they said we'd paid ahead for our monthly payments, thereby accruing more interest for themselves.

I then receive the freeze letter in the mail and also another letter saying that ive been removed from .... i forgot what it was officially called, basically credit cards/loan company 's cant pull my report for the next five years. Here are the problems. First off, lets say i want to unfreeze my credit report a few months from now ( im not saying i do, im just using that as an example! ) could i even apply to a credit card for the next five years? The 5 year thing confused me a bit. Is it just for when the credit freeze is in place? Could i have some extra details about that because tbh it seems a lot like i placed a freeze to help prevent my credit from being screwed over and then experian themselves XXXX me over. The main reason why im reaching out is because experian has been sending me emails ( marketing emails, i think ) about credit cards that im matched to, that im qualifed for. its more than just a one time thing as well. I've received at least a dozen from experian since placing the freeze. Im not sure what experian thinks but to me thats extremely concerning, Why is that happening when experian themselves said it wouldnt happen? Is someone else applying for those cards? Does someone else have access to my experian account? ( the online account or even the experian account itself, like the one you look at! ) Theres alot of different ways that i can look at this but all i know for a fact are these 3 things. 1 : Even under the best circumstances, it just being someone at experian doing some type of typo or something like that, thats still really bad because they still arent suppossed to be doing that. Whats the point of the credit freeze if it apparently doesnt freeze? I guess experian doesnt care about identity theft. Come on, you cant blame me for thinking that way when it seems to be that way! 2 : Experian better get to the bottom of this and BE HONEST while doing it because if i find out experian screwed something up and then lied about it as well, I swear on my grave experian will be 100 % liable for any damages that might arise from that. 3 : If there is anything that screwed me over because of experians mistake, That will be an extremely bad day for experian in court.

We have completed two trial payments and will make our third on XX/XX/XXXX. Again, were sent the same letter saying a title issue was discovered. This is not true, Caliber knew about the title issue from the first loss mitigation. 

U.S. Department of Urban Housing and Development Handbook 4000.1 Section III.A.2. 

5 ) End of Trial Payment Plan Period ( a ) Standard The Mortgagee must offer the Borrower a permanent FHA-HAMP Option after the Borrowers successful completion of a TPP. 

The Mortgagee must : prepare the permanent FHA-HAMP Modification Agreement early enough to allow sufficient processing time for the modification to be effective no later than the first day of the second month following the final Trial Payment Plan month ; provide the Borrower with the permanent FHA-HAMP documents to be executed by required parties at least 30 Days before the effective date of the modification with notification of the date by which signed documents must be returned ; sign the FHA-HAMP Modification Agreement and provide a fully ratified copy to the Borrower no later than 15 Days following receipt of the Borrower-signed documents ; and update its servicing system and files to reflect the FHA-HAMP transaction. 


On XX/XX/XXXX, we will be making our third and final trial payment for this second loss mitigation application. This will be the second time we have successfully completed the TPP. Why are we not receiving a modification agreement? Why did you approve the trial payments, and then send us the same subordination letter from the first loss mitigation application? 

We have submitted the subordination paperwork several times. What is the title discrepancy? Why will no POC specialist tell me what the discrepancy is? 

If the discrepancy is that we have a second lien, why are you approving loss mitigation applications, accepting trial plan payments, all the while knowing that our modification can never be approved due to having this second lien? 

If it is acceptable to have a second lien on an FHA title, then what is the title discrepancy you're speaking of?

We began our conversations with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and submitted all requested documentation shortly thereafter. Documentation was received, by them, on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Since that time, we've been dealing with XXXX XXXX - who informed us that SHE was our single point of contact ( untrue ). Her extension is XXXX. Over the course of the last 30 days, XXXX has told us that Underwriting had questions regarding our XXXX XXXX XXXX and supplemental Letters of Explanation. 

On four separate occasions, we were asked to resubmit the same documentation. ( at XXXX 's request, her saying that it was Underwriting asking for the updates/with no clear explanation ) It wasn't until last week, when we had an opportunity to speak with a different individual, that we were told exactly what the issues of those documents war. We took immediate corrective action and submitted those documents 24 hours later. 

Our next follow-up call, with XXXX, brought us the same results as the previous for conversations. Again, she insisted that Underwriting needed an explanation on the documents that we had repeatedly explained to her, over the phone and in the detailed Letters of Explanation. 

Yesterday we had a conversation with XXXX, extension XXXX, and again, we were told that there was a request for an explanation of our XXXX XXXX XXXX, our most recent bank deposits, and the Letters of Explanation, surrounding our lease agreement. ( We currently do not have a lease agreements with any subletters ) After explaining everything to her and her actually taking the time to look at the documents, she agreed that what we've provided is satisfactory for the individual who is - SETTING UP THE FILE TO COMPLETE IT AND THEN SEND IT TO UNDERWRITING. 

This means that our file has been pending set up approval for 30 days and Underwriting has yet to see it. 

It's painfully clear to us that XXXX is actively working to willfully mislead us and break our spirits. This is a very sizable loan and the value of our home has gone up, since we purchased it. 

We are requesting that you step in and demand that they take corrective action and move our Modification request through the process in a timely manner. Our mortgage payments are in excess of {$5000.00} per month and every month that goes by, the fees and penalties add up in a tremendous manner.

The details are : Open a 360 Money Market account and deposit at least {$50000.00} between XXXX XXXX  ET on XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. ET on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX and entering the promotion code "" OFFER500 '', then Capital One will deposit the {$500.00} bonus money into my account within 60 days after completing the above conditions. 

At the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the bank for the {$500.00} bonus which should be paid by the end of XXXX and the manager told me I am not qualified for their promotion.

His reason is the total new money deposited into my MMA is less than {$50000.00} and I have a saving account with their bank before. 

My answers to their concern are : 1. According to their requirement, the cumulative deposits should work on the similar bonuses, and my total deposited amounts are more than {$50000.00}. Meanwhile, the cumulative deposits are always working for Capital one other promotions and for their other clients. 

2. The saving account I have was opened in XXXX with XXXX. After 10 years later, it was transferred into Capital One due to the business changes. I do not open any saving accounts with Capital One directly before.

I have a medical history of hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroid. These medical conditions require me to get blood work done yearly. I have never paid anything more than {$20.00} for the bloodwork. 

When I received the bill I called my medical provider and explained the situation. She stated, it must have been coded incorrectly, Ill take care of it. I received 2 more bills in XXXX and called the medical office both times. Each time they said they would call and take care of it. The last communication about this issue was in XXXX, XXXX. I never heard anything more about it. I assumed it was resolved. 

As of the end of XX/XX/XXXX, the medical provider closed their office and moved to another office, not affiliated with the same hospital. My medical records did not move with her and I had to find another doctor. 

Fast forward to XXXX, XXXX. I started receiving a bill for {$190.00} from a company called XXXX. I admit I did not call this company as I thought it was odd I was receiving a bill for something that was supposed to be taken care of in XXXX. As I started repeatedly getting bills, I called the company in XXXX of XXXX. They would not do anything and demanded that I pay the bill. 

I then called the insurance company and talked with them. They looked into it and admitted it looked like a coding error. They tried to contact XXXX XXXX, and got nowhere with them. The hospital billing department refused to look into the situation. The rep from XXXX XXXX XXXX suggested I enlist the help of a 3rd party company that my company uses for these situation, XXXX XXXX. 

I started communication with them in XX/XX/XXXX. There communication with me was sporadic and I never really got any resolution. See below. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a letter was drafted by a law from by the name of Overton , Russell , Doerr and Donovan , LLP. I sent a letter to them on XX/XX/XXXX stating that I was not admitting to this debt and I was working with the 3rd party XXXX XXXX. I asked them to take no further action. I also followed up with a phone call. The woman on the phone stated they were not acting as a debt collector ; they were actually acting as the lawyers for XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a letter written by the law firm was sent to me stating the debt was due. I gave this information to XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX told me they were in the process of contacting the law firm. 

I heard nothing more from anyone. I happened to check my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX. It was on this date that I noticed they put this as a negative remark on my credit report. 

I contacted the law from the next day and inquired why this was done. They told me they heard nothing from XXXX XXXX. I paid the bill in full at this time as I did not want this derogatory remark on my records. Lastly, they told me it is not in their policy to reverse this on a credit report. 

I immediately emailed XXXX XXXX and updated them on what was going on. They are unable to speak with anyone at the law firm and they are refusing to do anything about it. 

In conclusion, I still believe this bill was in error and was due to incorrect coding. I believe it is an act of fraud, as the hospital refused to look into the situation. I received bills in XXXX and then nothing again until XXXX, XXXX?! I tried to resolve the issue and gave all the paperwork all the companies requested, yet I got nowhere. I was forced to pay a bill I still believe to be in error, and more importantly I was sent into collections over this and it negatively affected my credit.

The following is my experience. I would not have received this kind of customer service at my other bank. 

I made several purchase from XXXX for the first time. I went to the bank to deposit an additional amount of money to account for the purchases. 

I was unware XXXX debited the account after hours for a purchase I believed I accounted for during reconciliation. 

U.S Bank normally debits the account immediately. XXXX debited the account after business hours and I was unable to deposit additional funds. I was unaware of this until I logged in. 

When I logged in, I saw an overdraft of {$36.00}. I called in to customer service to explain the situation and expected the {$36.00} to be refunded. 

I spoke to 'XXXX ID # XXXX. She put me on hold for several minutes. This was a simple housekeeping error. XXXX did not provide the 5 star customer service the bank advertises. After about 5 minutes, she stated she is unable to waive the fee. 

I was very unhappy and dissatisfied with the length of time it took for this minor housekeeping issue. I asked for her ID # and she would not provide it to me. I asked several times and she did not respond. 

I asked for a manager which took about another 5 minutes. XXXX ID # XXXX a a manager took over. She was unable to provide the 5 star customer service and stated she would not refund the {$36.00}. 

This bank chargers overdrafts in a manner that is excessive. This needs to be reviewed. They use the overdrafts as a way add to the earnings per share. 

This call I initiated should have been 5 minutes. Instead, US bank and its management use these situations to penalize their hard working customers. It is a very poor customer service tactic. 

US Bank does not care that I am a very dissatisfied regarding this conclusion. They are happy to charge me {$36.00}. 

I will be closing my accounts and using my other banking relationships.

I lost my debit card along with the bank generated PIN mailer ( I tried to change the PIN but was unsuccessful ). Couple days later I logged into my account to see that there are some unauthorized ATM withdrawals made outside the country. I have contacted Wells Fargo and file a claim. After 10 days, I contacted them to know that they are denying my claim. Not happy about having my case denied, I contacted the operations complaint management executive office. They did a review on the claim and determined that the disputed activity was authorized by me or someone I had given permission to, and therefore the claim was closed. The reasons they gave was : Conflicting information regarding the security PIN. 
I have repeated told them that the only PIN that I had was the generated PIN mailer that was lost with my card. Also, I told them that I have attempted to change the PIN but was unsuccessful. They said that I changed the PIN with the automated system which is hard to believe because no bank allow client to change their PIN over the phone. Furthermore, they have not presented any evidence that the PIN used for the withdrawals is different that the generated PIN mailer, since they said that I changed it. ( I still have a photo of the generated PIN ). 
No attempts to use the card after it was closed. 
Again, not showing evidence that the card was not used after I reported lost. When I saw the unauthorized transactions, I turned the card off before even calling the bank. So logically after turning off the card and the bank blocking the it after I called, how would the bank know that the card was not used after I turned it off and they blocked it. I need a transaction history. 
Multiple successful online banking logins during the time of the disputed activity. 
Again, this is something that the bank can retrieve and provide the audit trail of the logins during the disputed activity. During the disputed activity, the only time I logged was when I turned the card off and called the bank to block the card.

The most frequent calls were made to my place of employment despite the fact I requested my employer not be contacted. 

I was kept on hold for an excessive time on XX/XX/XXXX and was not able to make the payment. The morning of XX/XX/XXXX, an employee at the local Check Smart called me to ask about the payment. I told her I had already made arrangements with the corporate office and would be calling today to make the payment. The employee asked that I come into the local office to make the payment. I explained that I was at work and could not come in at this time, however the corporate office stated the matter could be taken care of via phone call. The employee then stated, "" I know you aren't at work. I called your place of work this morning and was told you weren't there.

I should mention that Check Smart did disclose to my employer that they were trying to collect a payment on a defaulted loan. This was humiliating as a professional. 

Immediately following this call, I contacted the corporate office and paid off the loan in full, as promised. I was told the calls were being recorded for quality assurance purposes. The company should be in possession of a recording of these conversations and it should serve as proof that the above encounter did occur and the employee at the local Check Smart needs further training on Fair Debt Collection Practices as well as customer service.",,"COMMUNITY CHOICE FINANCIAL, INC.",OH,431XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/07/2019,Closed with explanation,No,,3171048

XXXX  new loan number assigned XX/XX/XXXX is XXXX I am requesting a copy of servicing file for all lenders that have had any interest in this loan. Additionally, I am requesting an audit of all the payments, trial loan modification payments and the payments independently paid for escrow account as a part of any trial modifications to bring the escrow account to a level balance, any credits, fees charged, interest of the accounting of all three loan numbers to validate the represented balance on the account plus any additional amounts claimed against this HOME EQUITY LOAN. 
XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, XXXX servicing, and XXXX plus XXXX XXXX have repeatedly sent partial accounting records on this HOME EQUITY LOAN that only go back to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and have stated they have no further records. Although XXXX  XXXX XXXX recorded a questionable transfer and assignment of this loan in XX/XX/XXXX and then filed for foreclosure and received a court order of such in XX/XX/XXXX, they have consistently responded to repeated requests for records by saying they have none from both the time they are claiming ownership of the loan from XX/XX/XXXX up to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX reassigned the loan and also they have none of the original XXXXt XXXX records from XX/XX/XXXX up to XX/XX/XXXX including a XXXX trial modification finalized with payments and also a {$2500.00} payment for escrow shortage. Even more conflicting is the fact that AFTER the XX/XX/XXXX alleged transfer of the loan to XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and also the XX/XX/XXXX foreclosure action, XXXX  XXXX signed XXXX trial modifications in XXXX and then in XXXX and accepted trial modification payments but apparently did not credit those payments anywhere that I can find. They also paid all taxes and insurance on the HOME Equity Loan during all years before the accounting begins with XXXX in XXXX and where it shows that XXXX back charges for taxes and insurance along with many fees and interest. Please see the attached index of events which will show the dates.

I do have a 2 think indexed and tabbed binder of all the documents that have taken a long time to trace back and put into order. I am happy to provide a copy if you require them but in all honestly I would guess that a bank should have that and all previous records to validate the balance and ensure all is in order. 

In addition, I am requesting validation of the accuracy of legal signatures and representation of the following documents : l. XXXXXXXX Transfer and assignment document recorded in XXXX and XXXX XXXX which is signed by XXXX XXXX and prepared by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have been disposed in several fraudulent signature convictions for signing assignments as representatives of XXXX XXXX  XXXX when  they were not in fact authorized to sign the documents. ( They signed up to XXXX a day illegally ). Please see the index attached for 5 cited actions against this person and corporation. 
2. XXXX XXXX Affidavit for foreclosure filed on behalf of XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX by XXXX XXXX, who certifies his knowledge of the loan documents and accounting and warrants them and the assignment as legally correct. Mr. XXXX is also cited for falsely signing documents and is also listed in the index document provided for your review of the history and documents of the HOME EQUITY LOAN. 
3. XXXX Transfer and assignment recorded in XXXX XXXX ( have not found it in XXXX XXXX yet ) that was prepared by Core Logic and signed by XXXX XXXX, who is also cited for falsely signing documents. In addition, the notary is cited as signing under various signatures and as falsely signing documents. 
Since there seems to be disparity between the ownership and accounting records and conflicting dates of service and accounting I request clear and accurate chain of title that has been reviewed as to accuracy legally and also an audit and accounting of the loan from the beginning of the loan thru todays date.

I had full intention of getting back into classes during the fall semester of XXXX. However I had my my loan deferment period end because I was out oaf school for so long. I skipped the fall semester again to try to get more hours at work so that I could try to pay some of it back. Looking into to lowering my over all payments from month to month, I was able to file for income driven payments for my federal loans. My payments went to {$0.00} because I only make about $ 13,000- {$15000.00} a year. This helped me out. However when I try to solve the same problem with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for the balance of {$580.00}, they have no options for trying to solve my problem. I am informed that they have no options available to lower payments. They instead try to see if there are any family members or friends that I can borrow the money from to make the payments. Telling them no to this option, my only option at the time was to pay them {$150.00}, which doesn't get applied to any balance that is over due.This payment was just to stop harassment of 6-10 phone calls a day and the emails to me and my my father who is the co-signer. I agreed to this, however, I asked that that amount get taken out the following day so that I could move money into the account. My next step would be to pay in amount of {$580.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. The next day XX/XX/XXXX they attempted to take out {$300.00} from my account. The payment didn't go through because I didn't that much in the account at the time. After this happen the phone calls and emails started right back up again.

My father reported to me that he had paid the amount and that I need to just get enrolled in school again to at least half time to get the account to go back into deferment which I can do. Even though this payment had been submitted I still received a phone call from this agency about trying to make a payment. All of the phone calls and email have been documented and I have dates to along with them. I have been made to feel like that i have no true options beside bankruptcy.

I was about to pay off my vehicle but due to poor health and mismanagement accrued nearly {$1900.00} in late fees. I asked for any amount to be waived. The board of directors was gracious enough to waive {$500.00} within a few days. I called numerous times to thank them and even emailed them. I called and asked On numerous occasions during the month of XX/XX/XXXX is I had to pay the late fees and what would happen. 

All of the representatives I spoke stated that there was no regular payment required, I could pay them at a later time and that all that would happen would be is that they would keep my title until the late fees were paid. I also used the contact feature on their webpage to tell them not to charge me a late fee on a late fee. Santander was still showing that I had my regular car payment due even though I had paid all principal and interest. 

XX/XX/XXXX we received a bill for {$.00} which we paid. On XX/XX/XXXX I began to receive notices from XXXX XXXX that Santander was placing 30 day late notices on my credit report. I thought for sure it was an error because the car was paid off so I just disputed it. My credit rating dropped 70 points almost disqualifying me from a business loan I am trying to take out for a veteran owned business. A new 30 day late was posted on my credit. I called Santander and emailed and sent messages through XXXX wondering what they were doing. For days they strung me along saying they would get back to me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I was contacted by XXXX XXXX who began angling the conversation to the point that I was not told by the agents that I didn't have to keep paying my late fees like my regular payments ( which I was ), that it was my fault this was happening ( yes the late fees but not the hit on my credit ). XXXX brow beat me by asking the same questions over and over like the detectives I used to work with, trying to get a confession. I gave up and stated to her that I was getting a lawyer for Santander ruining my credit. 

I was sent an acceleration letter for {$0.00}. The letter stated that if I did not give them {$0.00}, they would accelerate my loan or repo my car. Now My XXXX  score dropped 124 points in one day because they closed the account unexpectedly with a balance instead on reaching out.

I wanted to transfer the balance on a credit to AMEX to take advantage of a 0 % APR transfer for 15months. 

I got approved a line of credit, it was lower than what I was looking to transfer. Now we all know when you apply for a credit card you do not know what your balance is going to be, and if it would be high enough to transfer my existing balance over. 

So I went online to see if the balance could be increased and submitted the request, I called AMEX and talked to their credit line department. 

I was told I was denied, because I had to be a customer for at least 60 days before I could apply for a credit line increase. I was a little taken back on why this information was not provided in any of the disclosures I had just agreed to. I was told that it was an internal policy. If I am applying for a line of credit I should know everything that will untimely make my decision on whether or not to move forward with the application. This information would have made me decide not to apply for the card as I would not know what my initial line was going to be until I had applied. 

The promotion I was taken advantage of is for only good for 60 days, I have to wait 60 days to request an increase. I find this deceiving. If the information about waiting 60 days before a could submit a request to increase my line was provided to me in the disclosures that I had to agree to, I would not have applied for the credit card, not knowing what my initial credit line offer was going to be if approved. So now I have a credit card that is basically useless to me and an inquiry on my credit report. 

If I am applying for a line of credit, I should have all the information up front so I can make a decision on whether or not I want to move forward with the application or if the card is right for me.

I paid the balance owed and asked them to close the account. The bank however continued to allow automatic electronic debits - I was charged by a previous vendor {$14.00}, days after I requested and was told the account was closed. A phone rep from TD who called my home about 2 months ago confirmed the same story. 

Since the bank allowed the charge to go through ( that they should not have ), every month they add new fees and charges. Now the balance is over $ 200+ which is almost entirely fees - due to their error. 

They called me several times. A couple of months ago a rep called and confirmed my story. I told her that I was even willing to pay the {$14.00} from the charge that they shouldn't have allowed. I offered to pay the erroneous charge but told her I wouldn't pay any of their penalties. She said she'd put my on hold and ask her supervisor. She didn't come back, and I went to work. Several times they have called in the morning as I'm headed out to work, and I asked my wife to give them my cell # and if they would call me on it I would still try to resolve things with them. Instead they keep calling my home when I'm not there - but they don't call back even after I've asked them to. 

They often send letters advising that they will report me to the credit agencies for non-payment. I'm not sure if they have or not, but the letters and bills keep coming and I will be extremely upset if they report to the credit bureaus for something they THEY caused. That's an abuse of power in my opinion - they can effectively make it very hard for me to get credit and I have no equivalent ability - it's really a shame how the system works.

It informed me that my credit score had dropped and that XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) had illegally posted a collection account I have never heard of nor had an account with this company. My report shows that it was opened on XX/XX/XXXX with a balance of {$110.00}. I have no know knowledge of this company nor this debt. I have never had an account with them. I never receive a letter in the mail that gave me 30 days to validate or dispute this account. I never received a letter stating that I have an alleged debt with this company and owe a balance on that account. I have always understood that, if I receive a letter from a debt collector and do not respond within 30 days, they can automatically assume that the alleged debt is mine. Again, I have absolutely no knowledge of this account with them. I understand that, under the FDCPA guidelines for collection agencies, that, in order for me to go further with this account, I need ( 1 ) proof that they are the original holder of this debt and can legally hold me responsible for paying this debt and ( 2 ) contractual proof of obligation or an assignment SIGNED in BLUE ink from an officer from the original creditors corporation that I am supposed to pay them. 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) grants me the right to request validation of this alleged debt they say I owe. If I would have gotten anything in the mail from this company before they illegally reported to my credit report, I would have responded immediately within the 30 days by acknowledging that I have no knowledge of this debt with them and would have respectfully requested evidence that I am the person they are asking to pay this debt and a contractual obligation that legally binds me to pay them this debt. Upon them receiving my validation affidavit, they would have to legally cease from collection calls, letters, and efforts and delete the account from my credit files until they can legally validate this debt. But again, I never received such a letter about this account ever in the mail. They have illegally posted and reported to my credit file file without adhering to the FDCPA laws. When I got the email on XX/XX/XXXX, I proceeded to contact them via phone number that was listed on the account ( XXXX ) to find out more about this alleged debt and illegal reporting. The automated line said my call would be transferred to a customer service agent to assist me, but I was continuously left on hold. There is no other contact information, but by phone. Im not sure if this a scam or someone is attempting to hack my credit file or not. What I do know is that this company has broken FCRA and FDCPA laws but reporting a false account to my credit report without informing me through mail, email, phone, etc. My credit score has dropped tremendously in the middle of purchasing a home. Please help me get his account removed immediately. I have spoken to a consumer protection attorney who is prepared to sue this company for punitive damages for illegal debt collection practice violation under the FCRA and FDCPA because of the damages to my credit and opportunity costs with the purchase of my home and business ventures that have to be delayed until this illegal account is removed.

No review of my escrow was ever done by XXXX, I discovered what appears to be an error when I reviewed the two Escrow Disclosure statements from XXXX for XXXX and XXXX. The Escrow balance for XX/XX/XXXX shows an actual escrow balance of {$2200.00}, the next statement shows a XXXX actual balance for XXXX, a difference of XXXX when only XXXX should have been withdrawn from this account to pay for the monthly mortgage insurance. I have recently contacted by phone and email to XXXX and they have not responded. 

In XX/XX/XXXX my loan servicing was transferred to Mr Cooper ( Formerly Nationstar Mortgage. ) ( Account # XXXX ). Mr Cooper did do a escrow analysis in XXXX of XXXX. That analysis was completely mishandled and they indicate a shortage of XXXX in my account. Even though my account is currently at a XXXX deficit as of XX/XX/XXXX. Their major errors was their analysis to my Hazard insurance and Morgage insurance. They indicated the Hazard insurance was XXXX last year ( when it was actually XXXX ) and this year the correct amount of XXXX. The Mortgage insurance they again misquoted last year at XXXX ( the actual was XXXX ) and listed this year the correct amount at XXXX so they are showing a difference from last year to this year of XXXX increase. This is totally wrong. They are demanding the difference be paid in a lump sum or have my monthly payment increased to cover the shortage over a year period. I have contacted Mr Cooper by phone on  XX/XX/XXXX and was told someone would look at it but no one from their Escrow will call, just an email. I have also sent a letter stating the error. The new charges will be taking effect in XXXX so something needs to happen quickly. The simple facts are that my Hazard insurance has gone down from XXXX to XXXX. My taxes did go up from XXXX to XXXX, so the net effect of the two is only XXXX. I am already paying one shortage based on XXXX miscalculation and that was to be spread out over 5 years. 
I want both XXXX and Mr Copper to correct the errors made to my escrow account and have XXXX send the deficiency to Mr Cooper post haste. I want Mr Cooper to revise the shortage based on all of this information.

03/05/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"This complaint is specific to Wells Fargo, a company that I have been banking with for a very long time. They are denying my claim for fraudulent charges on my Wells Fargo Business Credit Card. I was alerted to this issue on XX/XX/2019, almost two full weeks after the card was reported stolen, was closed, and I was told not to worry about the charges by the representative.

My complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has many components which I have outlined below, but first and foremost it is regarding the denial of claim for fraudulent charges made on XX/XX/2019 totaling {$22000.00} USD that now I am being held responsible for. 

Helpful people from almost every other department and branch in Wells Fargo outside of the fraud the Wells Fargo Fraud Department, have expressed disgust, surprise, and utter disappointment that I am being held responsible for these charges. 

Given the evidence supplied in the Credit Card Fraud Evidence document attached to this complaint, as well as the simple fact that their own team approved the fraud claims on my Wells Fargo Business Debit card, there is no reason to close and deny my claim. The only acceptable resolution is that all of these charges be permanently removed from my account for the Wells Fargo Business Credit Card in dispute. 

I have further complaints in the matter regarding the manipulative, unhelpful, untimely, strong-arm tactics that that fraud team resorted to when the denial was issued. I was immediately made out to be the criminal, despite being the innocent party who has been a long a valued customer. Im asking for a full review and investigation of practices used to deliver or address customers who have had a denial of fraud claims and an apology for the conduct of the fraud team. It is my opinion and the opinion of those I have spoken to within Wells Fargo at various levels that this specifically due to the dollar value of the fraud and that my claim has been denied without a proper investigation of the facts before denying the claim. 

Additionally, in the case of fraud and a police investigation into the charges, time matters. After repeated questions to the representatives who handled my case on XX/XX/XXXX, I was repeatedly told that I didnt need to worry about anything and that the charges were obvious fraud and that Wells Fargo would take care of everything. Nearly two weeks later, after I called to inquire why the fraudulent charges were placed back on my card, they suggested that I would need to potentially provide unlimited and unspecified amounts of evidence to support my case. I was also told that no matter what evidence I supplied, there would be no guarantee of any results that would positively affect the decision in my favor. This is a tactic that I believe was used to stall and make the task seem insurmountable, demeaning, and potentially fruitless in order to scare and intimidate the customer from pursuing further action. However, I immediately supplied the evidence I could gather as a civilian and launched additional police reports beyond the initial XXXX XXXX Sheriff 's report for the theft of my wallet, cards, and phone from my vehicle on XX/XX/2019. There are currently several police departments across various locations where the charges occurred investigation the matter. The fraud team repeated claims theyre unable to supply the transaction times necessary to the ongoing investigation, hampering the multiple active and ongoing police investigations. Yet the fraud supervisor read off several transaction times to me on the phone when we originally spoke. I still have yet to receive a call back from the original supervisor I had called regarding the issue, nearly a week after leaving a message with him. 

On XX/XX/2019 I spoke to two representatives in the resolution department related to my case, who promised that it would be escalated and the team would be actively working to get the denial reversed and the investigation reopened. Yet, on Monday, XX/XX/2019 when I called again, the case had yet to be assigned. When I spoke with the new representative, she took on the case, but made no promises and was sorry someone told me incorrectly that they had the power to do what the previous representative had stated. After supplying all of the evidence, I called back two hours later, only to find the representative had still failed to contact the internal fraud department, and therefore I opted to begin contacting federal authorities and watchdog groups about the case. 

RESOLUTION : Again, the only acceptable resolution is that all of the fraudulent charges filed be permanently removed from my account for the Wells Fargo Business Credit Card in dispute and that any negative marks on my business or personal credit or accounts be removed. 

A resolution does not mean that I will not continue to pursue action against Wells Fargo for the losses and harm this has caused to my business, my family, and my health. Additionally, it does not mean that I will not also pursue action to stop the abhorrent practices of Wells Fargo related to denial of claims without proper investigation. What has happened to me should never happen to anyone again.

03/05/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"I would like to file a formal complaint against Wells Fargo Mortgage for excessive, unreasonable, and erroneous mortgage charges and fees. 

I was recently informed by Wells Fargo Mortgage that my final mortgage pay off was received at/ around XXXX on Friday, XXXX XX/XX/2019, the day of my home sales closing in XXXX XXXX , TX. I was informed by Wells Fargo Mortgage that all pay offs received after XXXX Central Time will not be processed until the next business day. Given I previously lived in XXXX XXXX, TX, which is within the Mountain Time Zone, this arbitrary cut-off time of XXXX CT places an undue and unreasonable hardship on me because, in that time zone, I am already an hour behind. That is, I would have had to complete this home sale closing transaction much earlier in the day, much earlier than usual for these sorts of transactions in this area of the country/ time zone. That is, I would have had to get my title agent and his office to complete this transaction much earlier than they are usually accustomed. Again, this arbitrary cut-off time of XXXX XXXX CT places an unreasonable hardship and undue burden on me to meet this cut-off time given the time zone location of this home sale. 

In addition and as noted, I was told by Wells Fargo Mortgage that my pay off was not processed until sometime in the late afternoon of Monday, XXXX XXXX, after XXXX XXXX CT. As such, I was charged a full, additional day of interest. This additional interest charge was applied despite the fact that my pay off payment had been received Friday evening, XXXX XXXX, around XXXX XXXX  CT. That is, despite the fact that my pay off payment had been received on Friday, XXXX XXXX , Wells Fargo Mortgage failed to process this payment for an entire additional day. Thus, Wells Fargo Mortgage was completely derelict in their processing of my mortgage pay off payment in a timely manner, resulting in an entire day of additional interest expense.

These kinds of arbitrary and unreasonably time frames as well as this sort of derelict behavior in processing payments are the kinds of issues that give financial institutions a bad reputation as well as raise serious doubt as to their fiduciary integrity. These sorts of practices also appear predatory and abusive in nature, with additional fees and expenses that appear unwarranted and excessive. These are the sorts of unprofessional practices that raise questions as to the goals and intent of these financial institutions. 

I have attempted to address these unfair practices with Wells Fargo Mortgage, but thus far, all I have been told is that they will investigate this issue. Nevertheless, I am still liable for these additional interest fees. 

Consequently, I would like to file a formal complaint against Wells Fargo Mortgage regarding their implementation of arbitrary and unreasonable time frames and their failure to process payment information in a responsible, timely manner. 

Please let me know if you need any additional information. 

Thank you for your time and attention in this matter.

The transfer of my account from the previous company took place and there were no issues with my account balances. 

However, the new bank - Synchrony Bank has a policy in place where they reduce my auto recurring monthly payments when I make additional payments. I had calculated exactly what my payments needed to be monthly to pay off my balance without accruing interest. Then I purchased another item that needed to be paid off after my upcoming bill in order to avoid interest. Instead of changing my monthly recurring payment, I decided to pay additional amounts as one time payments and I pre-scheduled them online to be once a week. I received a letter in the mail in XX/XX/XXXX from Synchrony Bank saying they had decreased my recurring payment based on the one time payment I had made. I chatted with a representative online who told me that is how this system works. It seems unethical to me that my payment would be reduced when I choose to make additional payments. That has never happened to me, not with the previous bank nor any other bank I have had a credit card with. 

On my XX/XX/XXXX invoice I was charged interest because they reduced my payment amount without my permission. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX and they resolved my account by removing the interest charge. I received another letter in XX/XX/XXXX where they reduced my recurring monthly payment again. It has not yet posted to my account and the representative can not assist me.

03/05/2019,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"XXXX University provided misleading information about the quality of the program claiming that smaller classes led by "" industry experts '' meant a higher quality education. The school claimed to have a "" strong rooted reputation for academic excellence '', insinuating the college would be around in the future ( See Attachments ). When in reality, in the fall of XX/XX/XXXX, the president XXXX XXXX cut 60 classes, hiked the tuition, and, "" delayed spending on software and professional development '' ( XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ). No doubt these financial setbacks affected the quality of the professors teaching the program and the program itself, especially, in a time of fast technological advances. About five years of financial struggles leading up to the XX/XX/XXXX announcement were omitted from the XX/XX/XXXX enrollment process misleading me to believe XXXX ( a private school ) had a better reputation than other higher learning institutions. I would not have obtained federal student loans if the university were honest about its financial trouble. However, Nelnet and the department of educations approved student loans. 

XXXX University omitted to tell their financial status and the likelihood that the school would shut down. According to the XXXX, the school had a negative enrollment trend for about five years leading up to when I applied in XX/XX/XXXX to begin attendance in XX/XX/XXXX. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX enrollment decreased from XXXX to XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ). By XX/XX/XXXX,  enrollment had fallen to XXXX students ( XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ). According to XXXX XXXX, "" XXXX 's tax returns show that revenues plunged from {$21.00} XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to {$15.00} XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and over the past two years, the university posted combined operating losses of {$6.00} XXXX ''. The school did not inform me of their financial struggles before I enrolled in my first class in XX/XX/XXXX, nor did they inform me of continuing losses while I was enrolled in XX/XX/XXXX, had I known, I would not have chosen to attend XXXX University. I pursued a graduate education because I wanted to gain the relevant skills to find a more fulfilling career with higher earning potential than I was able to obtain previously. I chose to attend XXXX University because they represented that their program would give me useful skills, that their degree would allow me to earn more than I previously did, and that these benefits outweigh the burden of paying off the obligations I would incur to finance the degree. 

Almost a decade of declining enrollment created a high likelihood that the XXXX 's reputation would be irreparably damaged to the point where the degrees they issued would be worthless in my local community and beyond. The college never notified me or otherwise made me aware that my degree would be worthless due to the quality of their curriculum as a result of their financial problems. After submitting numerous job applications ( over two years ), I realize I was not taught the useful skills that employers are looking for in the finance industry. I need to go back to college to obtain those useful skills. If I leave the degree off of my resume and a potential employer finds out about it, the chances of me being hired are reduced. If I am hired, I could be fired if my employer found out that I omitted to disclose my degree. In the future, as XXXX 's online presence dwindles, it will become difficult to prove that I have a degree at all. XXXX mislead me to believe that their degree would allow me to earn more than I previously did. 

Because of XXXX 's conduct, I have federal student loan debt, which has caused me stress, forced me to divert funds from other aspects of my life and otherwise burdened me. I have an inability to enroll in another graduate program. I am missing the opportunity to attend a better higher education institution and lack eligibility for not only additional federal student loans, but for a mortgage as well. Because of XXXX, I can not afford a house, which means I can not start a family. I take XXXX and XXXX  XXXX. As each day passes, I become closer to defaulting on my student loans.

I am not disputing the late payment in itself, but I am very upset that Synchrony would not take the time to understand my circumstances and assist me with this matter. 
I opened a XXXX  XXXX  XXXX XXXX card in XX/XX/XXXX. I consistently made my minimum payments each month. In XX/XX/XXXX, Synchrony urged me to enroll in paperless billing and I did.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a {$33.00} purchase that I forgot I charged to my XXXX  XXXX account and did not increase my automatic payment to cover this purchase. Synchrony assessed multiple late payments which caused this {$33.00} purchase to grow into a {$140.00} balance.

Synchrony Bank has all my contact information on file ( address, phone, email ) but never contacted me regarding this past due balance.

This year, I changed insurance companies, and notified them of this. They proceeded to pay BOTH insurance companies putting my escrow into a negative balance.

I have no idea where the extra money went, but it doesn't appear to be in my escrow account. Here are the excuses that have been given to me by my mortgage company.

1. I had one late payment in the first year. This is true, because I misunderstood how long I had to pay after the due date of the 1st.

2. I was told I did not have a conventional loan. After looking into this, I found that I DID HAVE a conventional loan.

3. I was then told that the investors did not allow me to pay my own insurance & taxes.

I had an attorney look into my paperwork and I have contacted the company that did the closing for me and they both agree that # 2 excuse & # 3 excuse are nor valid.

03/05/2019,Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I called Kimball, Tirey, & St. John, today on XX/XX/2019. They have lied to me on several occasions about my account and have done several unethical practices to get money out of me. First, they harassed me with letters during the period when I requested my validation of debt, but never received it. I reported that and afterwards, they finally sent me the letter. Then, they only sent me a letter stating that they would put this debt on my credit report, but was not harassing the other person involved and I believe this was a scare tactic because I have young credit, so they saw that as an opportunity to get me to pay this debt off quickly. They were only targeting me with this debt and not the person with a longer credit history. Once I got the letter, I immediately called to make a payment plan with a man who was over my case. I let him know that I was a college student and could not afford a lump sum or to make larger payments. I spoke to two men and I believe it was either in XXXX, XXXX or XXXX. But during those months I had been communicating with them. The first man lied to me in the middle of our conversation. He said once I made the {$250.00} payment plan, that he would take the eviction off of my record and by the end of the conversation he contracted that statement and said I would have to wait until I paid off of the debt. A month later, I called in to lower that payment to {$100.00} and the second man I spoke with told me that if I paid a lump sum of {$3000.00} that the debt wouldn't be put on my credit and that they would remove the debt from my record. These conversations were all recorded and can be used as evidence. He told me that once I come up with the lump sum that I could pay it off and that until then I would pay the {$100.00}. I stopped that plan once I reported to the CFPB that they were adding add fees to my account making my payments useless and then the debt became disputed. I have worked hard these months to come up with the {$3000.00} lump sum on my own, as a struggling college student. Today, I called to pay this debt off with the half amount we spoke about. I spoke with someone new who was on my case and she told me that the other guy no longer worked there and she had taken over my case. Again, I do not know if this is true or not, because they lied about everything today. Eventually, I spoke with the supervisor, XXXX, who was very abusive in her language towards me. She was very disrespectful and blatantly lied. She lied about the total of my debt and said we owed {$8000.00}. Now nowhere in my record does is it say I owe that much money and they have not sent me a single letter saying I owed that much. She said that the cost came from the apartment, but that was not true because we have court records of all the charges that came from XXXX Apartments and if it reached to {$8000.00} that is coming from this debt collection agency. She was not transparent about how much the debt collection agency was trying to profit off of my debt. She made it seem like I had no other option, but to pay the debt in full and from my previous conversations, I know that to be a lie. She said that they would not take this off of my credit and even with a partial payment they wouldn't, and from my previous conversations, I know that to be a lie. She also made up some random discount of 10 %, which is nothing. She said that she could speak to disrespectfully if she wanted to and could talk me to me however she pleased and I know that to also be lie due to FDA regulations. Throughout the whole conversation she was antagonizing me. She said I couldn't pay half, but would not give me an explanation as to why, which also makes me believe she was lying. According to the FDA, her behavior was illegal : falsely represent the amount you owe or the amount of compensation the collection agency will receive. She was not trying to collect a debt, only bullying, lying and verbally abusing me. She was forcing me to pay a higher amount than I knew I had to. All conversations are recorded and can be retrieved to show that I was offered to pay the {$3000.00} lump sum and I agreed.",,"Kimball, Tirey & St. John LLP",IN,464XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/05/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3170404

03/05/2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"On XX/XX/2019, we noticed unauthorized activity on our account. 

We called the bank at XXXX and asked for a freeze to be placed on the account. The representative on the telephone said he could not do this because he could not ID the caller, even though we provided all the information he requested. This was the first of a series of bizarre and incompetent actions by the bank. 

Since the telephone rep was useless, we rushed to the bank at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX, in person and were assisted by associate XXXX XXXX. The unauthorized activity reported was three online transfers from some money service called XXXX which we have never heard of and never used, in the amounts of {$50.00}, {$300.00} and {$500.00} totalling {$850.00}. 

The associate at first appeared to be helpful, stating not to worry at all, the good news is you always get your money back. We followed instructions carefully, the associate stated that this was a known issue with customer data stolen from cellular telephones serviced by XXXX. She placed phone calls in our presence and we were told that the issue would be resolved in about 10 days. Again, we requested that the account be frozen, and I was told that this would not be necessary, that the issue was a pretty standard claim that would be resolved easily. 

On XX/XX/2019, while waiting for a resolution, we noticed more unauthorized activity someone was trying to connect an unknown XXXX account to our bank account and made verification deposits and withdrawals. This attempt was denied by XXXX, but we again went to the same bank branch and reported the issue. This time we were served by XXXX XXXX, and this is where things got even more unbelievable. The associate said OK, let 's have your telephone and we'll call claims. We didn't understand and asked for clarification. The employee explained that it would be faster to call from a customer 's cellular telephone than to go through the main system. THIS IS LUDICROUS. We were visiting a bank branch because we had been victims of fraud possibly originating from cellular telephone hacks and we were asked to use our possibly compromised telephones rather than the bank 's which would be assumed to be more secure! We denied this and used the bank 's telephones! When Claims were contacted by the associate, they stated that they could not find a record of a fraud claim ( which was done on our first visit on XX/XX/2019 ) and that a new claim would have to be made for all the unauthorized transactions. A new claim was made. This time, a number was provided XXXX. 

I SPECIFICALLY ASKED THE ASSOCIATE why they could not just cancel or deny the unauthorized transactions, which were still pending, and she said once they are initiated, they can not be stopped. This is also absolutely untrue! 

Sensing that something was wrong, we trusted out instinct and withdrew the bulk amount of the money in the account in the form of a cashier 's check. We left a small amount of money in the account ( {$230.00} ) to cover some legitimate payments which had already been initiated PRIOR to the fraud. 

Again, we waited. 

On XX/XX/2019, again, an unauthorized transaction attempt was noticed. Someone attempted a XXXX transaction in the amount of {$1900.00}, and our account was now NEGATIVE!!! 
How the XXXX do you even authorize something like this from an account which by now obviously did not even have the funds and to top it off you were already notified of fraudulent activity!!!??? 

AGAIN, we went to our bank and were assisted by XXXX but in an office labeled XXXX XXXX. 
This time, the associate contacted someone who was able to cancel this transaction. He stated that the previous transactions also could have been cancelled but the employee who helped me obviously did not know how to do that and he wished he had been the one helping me, he would have done it. We were, by now in complete shock at this TOTAL CHAOS. 

XXXX was able to contact Fraud Operations who placed a HOLD on the account in the form of negative XXXX ( XXXX ), again we were told not to panic, the issue would be resolved in 10 days. 

The branch manager XXXX told us WE DON'T DO FRAUD HERE, THIS IS A BANK BRANCH THAT ONLY DEALS IN EVERYDAY TRANSACTIONS and DON'T WORRY, THESE THINGS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME!!! Very comforting indeed! 

So again we waited. 

Today is XX/XX/2019, our account is still frozen, NO REFUND HAS BEEN MADE, the three legitimate transactions we made prior to the fraud ( payment to XXXX {$100.00}, payment to XXXX {$25.00} and a check for {$77.00} ) were returned, resulting in issues with the payees, and NO ONE from the bank has either contacted us, or even apologized for that matter. The only thing we received were overdraft notices and e-mails. 

We sent 2 letters to the bank in writing - one to the customer service address on out statements in XXXX, FL and one to the corporate office in XXXX, NC.

03/05/2019,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Just a suggestion - I did write this with breaks between paragraphs, making it easier to read, but they seem to have been removed from the final edit. 

Hello, I am filing a separate complaint against XXXX with the Comptroller of the Treasury, so I am not going to go into the details of how this began ( unless you request that I do, in which case I'll be happy to ). What this filing is about is Experian not correcting information that they can see with their own eyes is erroneous. 

A couple of months ago - possibly closer to three - I filed a dispute against XXXX with Experian regarding an error on my credit report. ( I have not yet seen whether this also appears on XXXX  or XXXX  reports, but I will find that out shortly ). 

While XXXX is the culprit for not reporting over {$3000.00} in payments they've received from me in the last year and a half, Experian is complicit in refusing to recognize a blatant mathematical impossibility. I have received no correspondence whatsoever related to the results of the dispute, not from Experian nor the creditor. I see nothing on the report that shows that any change has been made - no comments, no anything ( I've asked them to direct me to where that is if I'm simply looking in the wrong place, but they have offered no help whatsoever in that regard ). 

Over the past year and a half I have sent XXXX {$150.00} a month ( this figure is the result of a payment agreement I came to with XXXX that they chose to remove me from, but that I nevertheless stayed true to ). These payments have cleared the bank and have been applied to the balance. Yet the report is showing that no payments have been made for the past 20 months! 

I noticed when about to submit this that it says I will not be able amend it later with any documentation. While I'm not prepared to do that at the moment, it really isn't necessary to provide proof of the payments because on the very same report, it shows that the balance has gone down by the total of the payments ( and it will have reduced even further by the time you get to this, as another payment just went out ). Yet XXXX refuses to acknowledge this and has even written off the balance as a bad debt ( I'm assuming that's what "" charge-off '' means ). 

Both things can't be true - that XXXX has not been receiving payments AND that the balance is being reduced. I know with certainty my credit score is suffering from this. Just last week Experian itself sent me an alert that I dropped from the "" good '' to "" fair '' range, even citing the XXXX issue as the reason! 

From here on in, if XXXX would like the reality to be that it's a bad debt that is not being paid down so they can write if off, then they should decline the payments. Or I will oblige them by stopping the payments, but I must hear that from them first. 

As an aside, I am unable to access any of this through XXXX. They no longer send me statements and from what I can tell, have removed me from their customer database altogether - there is no account for me to log in to. This is also something that needs to be changed, so that I can keep a closer eye on things. 

It's no secret that the bureaus receive most of their revenue from the creditors - how the government allows such a conflict of interest to go on is mind-boggling. 

Apologies for lack of brevity.

I called WEEKLY to try and resolve this issue. The first call in XX/XX/XXXX, I was set up on a payment plan. I was given a confirmation number and told to pay the first installment of the payment plan. I went through the terms and conditions with the woman and accepted. She said it should reflect on my account in 3-4 business days. I gave it 7 days, and my account still stated I owed the full amount. So I called back. This person I spoke to told me that the repayment plan did not get approved and they had tried to call me 3 times but my phone number was disconnected ( it definitely was not, I have had the same number since XX/XX/XXXX ). So we set up a new payment plan, I got a new confirmation number, I went through the terms and condition and they wanted me to pay the first installment. I had just paid an installment the week before, so he refunded the first payment and I paid another payment for this plan. He said it would reflect in 5-7 business days. I gave it 10 business days and my account still showed behind. So I called back. The person on the phone said the processing department was still working on it. I asked when I should call back and check, and he stated "" If you are that worried about it you can call back and check on it, but it is processing the new payment plan ''. 4 days later, it still was not showing and so I called back. This person said that my new payment plan was not approved but they knew a way to make it happen. I got signed up for a new plan, went through the terms and conditions and got another confirmation number. My payment for this plan was not due until XX/XX/XXXX. 7 days later, it was now past my original due date, XX/XX/XXXX, and my payment showed past due. I called back and spoke to another woman who was incredibly rude so I asked to speak to a manager. The manager came on and I asked her to explain to me what was going on. She said that one I made that first payment of the new payment plan, it would "" kick start '' and my account would go current. So I asked if I could go ahead and make the payment. So on XX/XX/XXXX, I made another payment to start my newest payment plan. She said I would get the terms and conditions in 3-4 business days and it would reflect on my account. I kept telling her I did not want this to go on my credit. She assured me it would not. I have checked my account since then, and it had never said current. It always said past due. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a delinquent letter. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and I was told that the new payment plan did not go through, AGAIN. I asked to speak to a supervisor. This woman stated that it was a new type of loan ( even though they have had this loan for 2 years ) and there was no possible way for me to get a repayment plan or new terms. I asked for deferment for 9 months - 1 year, and all she said was are you able to make the payment to catch your loan up? I asked her why no one has tried to call and tell me any of this and why I had been told that I would have a new payment plan so many times and she just kept saying she apologized for the inconvenience. I have been promised 3 different times a new repayment plan. And now there could possibly be a delinquent report on my credit. All I wanted was to defer or lower my payments until my husband could work full time again.

XX/XX/XXXX I wired {$33.00}, XXXX ( cash to close ) based on the fraudulent emails from my XXXX XXXX account to the Title company account in Wells Fargo. Apparently it turned out to be a private account and not the title company account. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from my transaction attorney asking me to go to XXXX XXXX and reverse the wire because money went to the private account. I was also provided with the phone number of Wells Fargo Fraud Department and the case number.

I called Wells Fargo Fraud Department from my XXXX local branch. 
I was explained that they noticed something was off and opened up a fraud case however didnt not stop the wire. The lady also mentioned there had been another fraud on the same account prior to me wiring the money. This is why they suspected something was fishy. 
Wells Fargo requested an indemnity letter from the XXXX XXXX to be able to reverse the wire. 

XX/XX/XXXX I filed a police report.

03/04/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Summary : Our mortgage company 's property loss division is refusing to release funds to us following the completion of repairs on our home that was damaged during Hurricane Florence. 
The mortgage company, XXXX XXXX XXXX, utilizes XXXX to handle their loan servicing, and the customer service we have received thus far has been unacceptable. They do not communicate important information and you can not speak with any management there directly unless they call you. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX we reported storm damage to our home resulting from Hurricane Florence to our insurer ( XXXX ) and our mortgage company ( XXXX XXXX ). An adjuster was sent out shortly thereafter and a report was made that resulted in the issuance of a check in early XX/XX/XXXX for {$24000.00} to begin repairs. The check was taken to an office of XXXX XXXX to be endorsed so we could deposit the funds. When we returned to the home after the evacuation, we discovered additional damage not noted by the adjuster. We worked with a storm mitigation company, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX, FL, to demolish and clean the storm damaged portions of our home. This required the removal of significant drywall, insulation, and flooring. The insurer paid XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX {$27000.00} directly in XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the insurer also paid {$13000.00} to us directly for flooring repairs and another check that was sent to XXXX XXXX for endorsement. It too was endorsed and returned to us for deposit. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, we submitted our final settlement request to our insurer to cover the remaining damage. At this time, we were about 90 % complete so we sent a request to XXXX XXXX to schedule an inspection. Our request was canceled but no one called us to explain why nor to even notify us of the cancellation. We contacted XXXX  on or about XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about the inspection and the agent was unable to explain what happened. However, we learned that XXXX now wanted significantly more documentation and agreements to be signed before they would process our claim. We submitted additional documentation at that time that explained the basis for the entire claim amount ( {$84000.00} after deductible in total ) and put in a second inspection request at that time which also inexplicably was cancelled. 

In early XXXX, I spoke with another agent and requested that I receive a call from a manager. Two days later, a XXXX manager, XXXX XXXX, contacted me and explained that they needed additional information from us. We identified what should be provided by the insurance company and I contacted our adjuster who forwarded the letter on the same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ). This was submitted to XXXX at their web site. Shortly thereafter, XXXX   informed me that the information was not what they needed and they wanted additional information. XXXX contacted the insurance company adjuster directly to speak with them. The insurance company again forwarded the requested information. Our insurance agent also contacted XXXX  on our behalf to get this matter resolved. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a third request to XXXX for an inspection. At this point we are essentially 100 % completed on our repairs. This too was canceled without notice or explanation. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the mortgage company and spoke to XXXX regarding this matter. She tried to help me but said she needed to get a letter from the insurance company regarding the basis for two of the payments ( {$13000.00} and {$19000.00} checks ). She called and spoke to XXXX at my insurer and said that they would be sending a letter today and that it would take 24-48 hours before it would be available for review on XXXX  system. At this point, I dont have confidence that this will result in an inspection being scheduled. 

My understanding is that under the law, the mortgage company can not retain funds once the insured property has achieved 100 % completion of repairs. I do not understand how XXXX can continue to engage in these practices.",,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",NC,,,Consent provided,Web,03/08/2019,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3168457

NOTE 2 : 1. None of the 6 monthly payments I made to Shellpoint were ever applied to my Mortgage. They are all held in suspense!

2. Shellpoint is charging me a late fee every month in addition to other erroneous fees. Also, according to Shellpoint I am charged with no record of payment for XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, XXXX, when I made three payments of {$1500.00} to XXXX for the Modification Trial Payment.

03/04/2019,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"Hello. My story is sad but true. It's like millions of others, I'm sure but still no less sad because it is my own issue. My own life 's issue. I am an XXXX and I pursued my dream of being an XXXX  when I went to college, XXXX University, and then was accepted into the prestigious XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   Graduate XXXX Program at XXXX. It was a great program and one where students were afforded many professional opportunities that many XXXX who hadn't gone to school didn't receive. I had received {$40000.00} in scholarship money to attend XXXX and I borrowed another {$40000.00} to pay for living expenses and the tuition difference for the next three years. In addition to the {$10000.00} I had taken out for XXXX study from XXXX, in XXXX I was {$50000.00} in debt with principal at 8.25 % interest. I also had taken out a Perkins loan for {$2500.00} that I had paid off within five years of graduation. After graduating XXXX, I worked in theater steadily for the next three years. My salary at $ XXXX week wasn't tremendous but I was a working XXXX! After the 6 month grace period however my loan servicer, then Sallie Mae, told me I would owe $ XXXXmonth on top of my rent and bills but if that would be a problem they said I could defer payments for upto 2 years or I could "" forbear '' payments, essentially stopping payments, basically so I would not have to worry about payments. As the years went by I had to keep forbearing or deferring payments. My loans were bought and sold as so much trash by XXXX, Navient, Sallie Mae, and finally Navient again. I'm sure there were other servicers who bought the loans but I can not rememember all of them. They seemed to change each or every other year. I would constantly ask for statements at the end of the deferrment period to see how much interest was 'capitalized ' to the principal but most of the servicer 's employees were from XXXX and either they didn't understand what I meant when I said, "" Please send me a paper statement when the loan is about to start repayment so I can see how much interest has accrued '' or they just disregarded it as unimportant. It was probably the latter as I'm sure many of us asked for statements but because the loans had switched hands so much the servicers only needed to get permission to defer or forbear payments and then forget about the rest of the service call. Their bank was getting what they wanted. People whose initial principal wasn't enormous, although owing {$50000.00} is pretty enormous would see the balance balloon to enormous sums because we weren't being kept aware of how the principal kept growing. The agents were always so understanding and supportive on the call about giving out more deferment or forbearance time because we needed help. Outside of paying my rent on a New York rent stabilized apt , borrowing for school has been my only borrowing experience. Fast forward to some years later when I was in a long running play, or on tour and I would have a modest steady income and I would try and knock off some of the principal but the interest alone now was over {$1000.00} so I asked about repayment options. I was put on income sensitive plans or income contingent plans and had some years where I was able to pay some of the loan 's interest back but unfortunately those plan were not the 'right income sensitive ' plan to qualify for payments towards loan forgiveness. Once again, misleading information that is only found out years later when the issue is too big now to be ignored and I'm trying to figure out a way out of this mess. As it stands right now I have about two, maybe three years towards loan forgiveness. My principal is now {$90000.00}! I am in the "" REPAYE '' plan which I need to reapply for each year. This year my payment was $ XXXX month based on my expenses and income from the previous year however I'm still not paying anything toward taking down the principal so the interest gets added to the amount and the amount keeps growing. I'm XXXX years old. Still an XXXX. I make around XXXX/year between XXXX work, side gigs like XXXX, and unemployment but it changes every year and I don't receive a weekly check like a banker. I get paid for something then I have to stretch that money out to pay health insurance/medical costs, union dues, not to mention rent, bills and the occasional piece of pizza. I live in XXXX which is very expensive. I have under {$10000.00} in retirement savings and with streaming media taking away a lot of union work XXXX in commercials things have been getting worse and worse in the last 5 years. Producers and ad agencies don't care about XXXX. There aren't government regs to restrict this from happening and our union is virtually a non factor in protecting our livliehood. I yearn for a night when I can sleep through without waking up in an anxious sweat. I have this {$90000.00} debt hanging over my head with no real possibility to pay it off in my lifetime. I'm wondering how I could have let this happen but more importantly, I'm wondering why there aren't any regulations in place to protect borrowers from this sort of practice. The 'ever polite and supportive bank who says, "" You can have another forbearance, no problem ''. Additionally, had I been told about the "" proper '' repayment plan to be on years ago, I would have a few more years invested in the loan forgiveness program and I would not be staring down this dark tunnel. Had their practices been less predatory in a 'folksy kind of way ' but instead 'transparent in an honest way ', I would not be 25 years out of graduate school looking at double the amount I borrowed with not very good prospects to pay it all off.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NY,100XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/05/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3169383

03/04/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with customer service,"Company : Synchrony Bank ( d/b/a Care Credit ) Complaint :  Repeated refusal to provide copy of initial account agreement to prove both parties are jointly responsible/liable for the balance on the account ( as opposed to one primary, and the other - merely an authorized user ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened this Care Credit account for the support and XXXX  care of the many rescued ( abused )  companion animals that reside ( for life ) in my home. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, an adjunct card - XXXX  - was added for the sole purpose of a one-time purchase of prescription eyeglasses by XXXX XXXX XXXX, who was added as an authorized user for that expressed purpose at that time ... to the best of our collective recollection. 

Despite being paid off in a relatively short time, the account lay dormant for several years, until - at my behest - it was closed for non-use on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX and I are divorced, and are amicably seeking to separate our finances : To that end, we have repeatedly asked Synchrony Bank to remove her from any and all liability for the remaining {$3700.00} balance ( out of a {$4500.00} limit ). 

They have stubbornly refused to provide proof that both of our names were added as account holders at the time the initial application that created this account was filed. 

It is our recollection and contention that she is merely an "" authorized user '' who did NOT participate in the original application ( as required by law ) and should therefore NOT be liable for the remaining balance, and should indeed have her authorization revoked ( at our request ) and her name removed from the account ( and subsequently, have this account removed from her credit reports ). 

Despite numerous online and email messages being sent, the sole paper correspondence received that actually addressed this issue ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) completely ignored our request - and provided no contact information by which to reach the originator ( no phone, nor email address ), other than a post office box to which written correspondence might be directed. 

Completely useless and meant to delay actually addressing our specific request. 

Per Synchrony 's directions, XXXX had sent a letter on XX/XX/XXXX, requesting the actions specified above. 

Having received an inappropriate response - which failed to address our simple request - dated XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ) ... followed on XX/XX/XXXX, by yet another utterly irrelevant document ( also attached ) ... online correspondence from myself which had commenced on XX/XX/XXXX continued through XX/XX/XXXX ... accompanied by numerous, lengthy telephone calls amplifying our repeated requests. 

Despite clear, unambiguous, specific requests for the original account application, Synchrony Bank has refused to address that request and provide proof that both of us requested and signed the initial application that this account was approved and authorized by. 

Interestingly - and disturbingly - during these many weeks, "" remarks '' were added and removed from our credit bureau reports ... remarks that we were unable to actually see, but that had decidedly negative impact on our credit scores - lowering each by several points. 

We firmly believe those remarks were retaliatory in nature, and included for the sole purpose of punishing us for our continued, dogged pursuit of the documentation requested. 

We are asking the assistance of CFPB to compel them to address this simple request and provide proof-positive of XXXX 's "" account holder '' designation, as opposed to mere "" authorized user '' status.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,MN,,Older American,Consent provided,Web,03/04/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3168839

03/04/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"I recently had a problem with my Nordstrom Credit Card, and I would like this situation duly noted and/or reversed in my credit file, as my FICO score has now taken a hit as a result of Nordstroms error. I remind you that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Consumer Protection Act, you have an obligation to do so immediately.

I have been a Nordstrom Credit Card holder for more than 13 years, spending tens of thousands of dollars with them over the lifetime of my loyalty to them. During this time, I was also a Nordstrom Loyalty customer, and I regularly received reward certificates for my spending. 

In XXXX, in XXXX XXXX, I made a {$1200.00} purchase for a business trip to XXXX. I was traveling a lot for work and out of the country, so when I finally returned home, I received my XXXX statement in the mail, and I realized I was two days late in paying my bill, so I used the automated phone service Nordstrom has to pay a bill online ( this is a 24/7 bill pay phone number at XXXX ). 

I paid the amount in full on XX/XX/XXXX, and I immediately received an automated billing confirmation number and payment proof was also received in writing when reflected on my next Nordstrom statement ( SEE ATTACHMENT # 1 and # 2 indicating payment on XX/XX/XXXX while a late fee for {$37.00} was assessed and charged on the same day payment was due - redacted for this version ). 

When I received my following months statement, 2 statements later, not only did the payment show as adjusted and reversed, but I had received a collections notice, too, indicating that my account had gone to collections and was now reported to all credit agencies ( ATTACHMENTS # 3 and # 4 - redacted for this version ). 

When I contacted the collection agency, they did not understand the issue, so they had to patch in someone from customer service at Nordstrom, whose name was XXXX XXXX ( not her real name, Im sure ). A very terse and unhelpful Ms. XXXX said that their automated payment system had used an account for my bill from a bank account we no longer have open. This account at XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX has been closed since XX/XX/XXXX! I buy at Nordstrom multiple times per year. How could they have on file, an account that has been closed for 7 years!? Ms. XXXX also indicated that they did not have an email or phone number on my account, which is not true. I regularly receive emails from Nordstrom - both promotional and billing related. I never received an email notice or phone call or letter ( other than my statements ) indicating that this account was late or not paid, and I never received notice that they were using a closed bank account that had not been open for 7 years.

Nordstrom has had several credit breaches. Most recently, a security breach in XXXX, XXXX. What has likely happened is that during one of their breaches, they had to restore their customer account systems, and they picked up an old and expired customer record for me, which included this closed/invalid account at XXXX XXXX XXXX. What I can not understand is how their automated payment system allows a payment to be accepted, go through and be verified as paid without having to confirm that its a valid and open account? Is this not the definition of wire fraud?! 

When I challenged Ms. XXXX, she admitted that I had made a payment online with good intent, and therefore, she agreed to dismiss any late fees ( for which I recently received a check for {$99.00} ). But, the damage is done. It was reported to credit agencies already. I asked her to report this situation to the Big 3 credit agencies, so that you can note this problem and provide an explanation in my records, but she refused to help me in any way.

And, for this reason, I asked her to close my Nordstrom account forever.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,CA,921XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/05/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3169363
03/04/2019,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,,"This is a continuation of 3 complaints already submitted. I am trying to put all of the pieces together little by little. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we were granted a HELOC on the property at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CO XXXX. The amount of the HELOC was {$46000.00} thru XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

This loan was being handled by HSBC as of XX/XX/XXXX. I paid on this loan, to HSBC, for 4 years and never saw a decrease in the principle amount. The statements I received never addressed the loan rate nor any monies being given credit for. That continued for the four years I paid on it, not knowing what the terms of this loan were. For how many months nor the interest rate, because it was never recorded with XXXX County Clerk and Recorders Office when the Deed of Trust was recorded. Not until I filed my complaint with you did I finally receive this important information. 

The payments I made over 4 years never reflected any decrease in the principle amount. I took it as blind faith that this loan was made with honesty. But this was during the mortgage banking problems that were happening at the time. 

Because of this lack of information, it gave me cause to doubt the legitimacy of this loan causing me to default. I had no idea of the terms of this loan until XX/XX/XXXX with your help. 

HSBC charged off this loan on XX/XX/XXXX and then sold to XXXX/XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX. For 4 years I never received any correspondence from either cpany until I began receiving statements from XXXX showing a balance due on this loan as being {$46000.00}. Why was I not made aware of this for 4 years and why did it take 4 years before the collections started. 

The balance due was reflected on all statements I received until XX/XX/XXXX when, again with your help, HSBC finally sent the information showing a balance due of {$49000.00}. Had I been aware that some of my payments had been credited to the priciple balance I would not have defaulted at all. The payment history furnished by HSBC shows I was making payments continuously, without cause for default, until I started questioning it's legitimacy.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,CO,,,Consent provided,Web,03/11/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3169361

Please be advised that this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ) that your claim is disputed and validation is requested.

This is NOT a request for 'verification ' or proof of my mailing address, but a request for 'VALIDATION ' made pursuant to the above named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your office provide me with factual evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you.

Please provide me with the following : -What the money you say I owe is for ; -Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe ; -Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe ; -Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable ; -Identify the original creditor ; -Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account ; -Show me that you are licensed to collect in my state ; and -Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent.

If your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the three major Credit Bureau 's ( XXXX, XXXX or XXXX  ), said action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent I will not hesitate to bring legal action against you for the following : -Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act -Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act -Defamation of Character If your offices are able to provide the proper documentation as requested, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. 

Also during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel. This includes any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate when in fact there is no provided proof that it is. 

If your offices fail to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your offices to my home or to my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls or correspondence sent to any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit.

The loan was not in default with XXXX XXXX. I always paid the full amount due even if it were a few days behind. I never had an issue with debt with XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, me and my husband, became behind on the loan payment because both my husband and I became ill ( he having XXXX XXXX   and me having a XXXX XXXX ). Unfortunately, we were unable to make a timely payment due to medial conditions. This is when I learned of Tower Loan.

I received no notification that Tower loan had taken over the account until I became behind when sick. So, when I did get a few dollars to pay on my account this is when calls began because to tower loan the payments made were not a sufficient amount and on top of this they increased my interest and payments. Something I had no knowledge of. I explained to Tower loan my economic hardship, by letting them know this new amount was not agreed on and that I could not afford, but they didn't care. They wanted money. I remembered I had a loan insurance, so I asked about the insurance I had on the loan and if I could use it to catch up on payments. I was told yes and was given forms by the customer service rep who remains unknown. She is no longer working there. 

I was told the forms had to be filled out by a physician. I gave the forms to the XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, who worked with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( PCP ), but at the time he was convicted of medicaid fraud and could no longer practice medicine, which is why I think the first set of forms were misplaced. I went back to tower loans and received a 2nd set of blank insurance claim forms, but still have yet to get them from XXXX XXXX. He is no longer in an office. I now see XXXX XXXX, XXXX, who worked with XXXX XXXX. I gave the forms to her, and at this moment I am still trying to get her to fill out the insurance claim forms. I don't think she want to fill them out because I was a patient of XXXX XXXX. She is also requesting {$25.00} to fill out the forms. But, while in this process dealing with getting forms filled out and approved, I have been 200 % harassed by tower loan. Here are incidents as follows ; 1. Frequently visited my home asking for payments 2. Visited the hospital while I was an inpatient to seek a {$6.00} payment 3. Left a voicemail stating he was my mother ( who is deceased which is my grandmother ) stating they are seeking payment.

4. I have filed a restraining order on XXXX @ Tower Loan. He is not longer able to visit my house. 
5. Branch Manager of tower loan is now visiting the house.

6. Threatened of Wage Garnishment Due to all that happened, I filed a restraining order, and I was served a civil law suit by Tower loan 's lawyer. In court ( which was ruled in a hallway and papers were signed ) we ( me and my husband ) received a payment extension and agreed to pay {$260.00} ( my husbands loan ) and {$160.00} ( my loan ). Since court all payments have not been missed and paid on time. I was not given a set date to make a payment as long as the payment is made by the end of the month. The original payment date with XXXX XXXX was due on 1 loan which was XXXX of the month. The 2nd loan was due the XXXX of the month. 

Now I am being told that I need to make another extension by tower loan prior to the arrangement made in court and once again. The 1st arrangement they said has expired. 

Today, Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I went in to Tower loan to make a payment. I gave them {$400.00} for my husbands loan ( {$250.00} loan mentioned above ) and {$200.00} for my loan ( {$160.00} loan mentioned above. I gave a cash payment to the cashier totaling {$600.00}, ( they only take cash, check, or money order ) to pay on the accounts respectively of what I mentioned above, and she felt the need to take out of the {$200.00} payment, {$50.00} and apply it to the {$400.00} cash payment for my husbands loan. When I said that this is not how I wanted the account to be paid, I was told that "" Louisiana is a community property state and that she has the right to take money from one account and apply it toward another account '' "" Then she proceeded to confirm that we were married, by asking, but the payment was already made. So, what if we were not married I asked? With no answer relative to us being married, she told me that the money could not be reversed. And I quote. This is what she told me.

Hotels, usually just process your credit card and give you a room, even on an extended stay. I need to know if this company had the authority to perform such an act, using my Visa debit card.

I paid {$700.00} instead of my regular payment of around {$430.00}. The American Education Services ( AES ) website says the following as far as paying over, "" Yes, you can pay more than the amount you owe. Any interest or fees that have accrued on your loans will be paid first before reducing your principal balance. '' However, I found that after I paid over, AES instead paid the additional {$270.00} to the following months loan payment. I had to call them to get my payment fixed, and then was forced to send them a written message asking them to put any money I paid over in the future to the principle of my loan. Like their own website already says they do. 
I again paid over my payment amount for XX/XX/19. I paid {$620.00} instead of my normal payment of {$420.00}. I got the verification that my loan had been processed correctly and then saw later that it had been changed so that the extra {$200.00} had been moved to the following months payment. After I was forced to call again, I was told that it would take 7-10 business days to be corrected. Now I see that when they finally corrected it, they only credited my account for {$420.00}. The additional {$200.00} I paid, magically disappeared, but was still taken from my bank account. 
After being forced to call them again, I was told that it was going to take them 7-10 business days to apply the missing {$200.00}. I am awaiting to see if this is done correctly. I also had to pay my loan again today for XX/XX/19 not knowing if its going to applied correctly or not. Luckily I have been watching my account or AES would've been applying my loan payments incorrectly, or basically stealing my money. 
I am forced to attach some screenshots I have taken from my account. I have not received a correct statement from them in going on 3 months now because of their constant errors, so I don't have copies of them at this time.

03/04/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"XX/XX/XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX Tel : XXXX SUB : MR. COOPER LOANS A/C #, Property Address : Dear Sir / Madam, I am writing to you after going through painful procedure with Mr. Cooper. I have purchased my home in XXXX of XXXX. It is my primary home and I tend to keep it. Since XXXX my main mortgage was always on auto debit. During the last 17 plus years, my loan was transferred to multiple lenders but my auto debit continued without any problem. I never had to check my account to ensure about the payments as it was going on for over 17 years via auto debit. 

The problem started when Mr. Cooper stopped taking auto payments from my bank account in XX/XX/XXXX. I have a copy of XX/XX/XXXX statement which states that my auto debit will be on XX/XX/XXXX. I thought everything is going as usual. Copy is attached for your reference which clearly states that my next payment will be auto debit. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I got a first call from someone stating that they are from Mr.Cooper and started threatening me that I did not pay mortgage for 3 months ( XXXX XXXX ) and they are going to foreclose my house. I was shocked and promised to call them back after checking with the bank. 

I checked with my bank and realize that Mr. Cooper did not post the payment from XXXX. I called them back asap and try to resolve it. I inquired that why they stopped taking the payment to which they were giving me multiple answers. First they said that I stopped it which was wrong as I didnt. Then they said its your husband who stopped it which was wrong again. Then they put me on hold for almost 15 minutes and told me that the auto debit was supposed to be finished until XX/XX/XXXX and I have to reinstate it. Wrong information again as I have XX/XX/XXXX statement which states that auto debit will be on XX/XX/XXXX which never happened. After 40 minutes of conversation, they were still unable to give me a satisfactory answer. I wanted to resolve the issue but it was impossible for me to pay entire 3 months of payment. The agent suggested loan Modification which I liked. I was told that they will put me into a 90 days trial payment plan and upon successful completion of it, I will be able to go for Loan Modification. I agreed. I also asked them to if I can make a payment for XXXX to which I was told that no payment can be made until I clear the 90 days trial period. 

My first payment was on XX/XX/XXXX for {$370.00} XX/XX/XXXX ( for XXXX Payment of {$370.00} via phone call XX/XX/XXXX ( for XXXX ) - Payment of {$370.00} via phone call XX/XX/XXXX ( for XXXX ) - Payment of {$370.00} via phone call XX/XX/XXXX I made the last payment of the trial period and inquired about the next steps. I was told that I qualify for Loan Modification and will get the documents in the mail. 

XX/XX/XXXX I waited and did not get any document in the mail. I called them again as I was worried about the XXXX payment. I made payment for XXXX for {$340.00} and inquired about the Modification documents. I was told that they will send out the documents in the mail as they sent one in XXXX which never came. Please note that no deadline was mentioned at that time. 

XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I called at XXXX XXXX and spoke to XXXX . I received Modification Documents which requires mine and my husbands signatures. Deadline to mail documents was XX/XX/XXXX. I was shocked and asked them about the deadline as I was receiving the documents after the deadline. I was told not to worry and send the signed and completed forms. I inquired about my husbands signatures as he had filed bankruptcy in XXXX and was discharged of the debts. The agent had no answer and took my number to call me back on this, which never happened. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called again at XXXX XXXX and spoke to XXXX. I inquired about my husbands situation. I was told about the quit claim deed and was routed to XXXX County Recorder of Deeds. I was given address where I have to mail the loan docs. I inquired about the XX/XX/XXXX deadline with the fact receiving the docs in XXXX, I was told not to worry and send the docs. They promise to send me a shipping label. 

XX/XX/XXXX I was worried about the payment. I spoke to XXXX at XXXX XXXX   and made a payment for XXXX for {$340.00} XX/XX/XXXX - With all this additional stress, my health deteroit. I got weak and was not in a stable condition to go over this painful procedure. I want to ensure that I am in my proper state of mind to sign the documents. As soon as I got better, me and my husband completed the forms. I called Mr. Cooper and left voicemail for XXXX. I waited but no call back from them. Called again and spoke to XXXX who sent me the shipping label via email. I was stressing out and did not want to be late. I make another payment of {$340.00} with her for XX/XX/XXXX. She told me to mail docs by using the XXXX envelope and the label which was emailed. 

XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I got the documents notarized and took the documents to XXXX as the return envelope was from XXXX . XXXX refused as the label which Mr. Cooper sent me via email was of XXXX. I got confused as I could not figure out which provider to use XXXX or XXXX. I called Mr. Cooper and spoke to XXXX. I explained him the issue. He spoke to his Manager and apologies as they sent out the wrong envelope and wanted me to mail the documents via XXXX as the label was from XXXX. I also inquired about the deadline of XX/XX/XXXX t which I was told that its fine, just mail the docs. I rushed from XXXX to XXXX as they were about to close in 7 minutes and my commute was of 7 minutes. I rushed and made it to XXXX on time and mailed the documents. 

XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX-Documents received by Mr. Cooper. Finally! 

XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX-Spoke to XXXX who told me that I was behind since XXXX XXXX- I have to repeat every single thing to him. He said my Loan Modification is  denied as they did not receive the documents on XX/XX/XXXX. I got frustrated as I was constantly in communication with them and kept following whatever I was told. XXXX, however, resubmitted the Loan Modification and wanted me to check in about 23 weeks. I wanted to make a payment for XXXX with him as I do not want to be late, he refused and mentioned that he can not accept any payment at this time and there is nothing he can do about it. 

XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX-Received letter from Attorney for a court date on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Called at XXXX XXXX and spoke to XXXX who said that Foreclosure is on hold due to Loan Modification proceedings. Upon inquiry for court date, she put the attorney on a conference line. Attorney confirmed and that the hearing on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  is for amendment only. There is no need to make an appearance. XXXX wanted me to call after every 2 weeks to check the status of Modification. 

XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX-I called at XXXX XXXX and spoke to XXXX who reorder Loan Modification and wanted me to check with her by the end of month. I tried to make a payment for XXXX and XXXX and was refused again with the same message that they cant accept any payments as house is in foreclosure but here is no auction date. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I called again at XXXX XXXX and spoke to XXXX. I insisted to speak to Manager but she was making excuses and was not willing to bring the Manager on line. I have to go through the entire story with her again. I emphasized to speak to Manager. I then got upset and stated that is your Manager refusing to talk to me and only at that time, Manager came over on phone. At XXXX XXXX, I spoke to Manager XXXX XXXX, ID No XXXX. She stated that foreclosure started back in XX/XX/XXXX to which I was surprised as no one mentioned to me until XXXX of this year. It means that they were fooling me around so that I keep paying and they keep playing with me like a pinkponk ball. She further stated that loan modification was sent numerous times and we failed to submit documents numerous times thats why they keep rejecting the loan modification. I clearly stated to her that it was only one time that loan modification documents were sent out and that too after the deadline and I have send them back in a timely manner to which she had no response. I told her that I am extremely disappointed and looks like all they want is my house due to equity in it. They are fooling me since then. I have been played. I told them I am filing an official complaint with CFPB and also with attorney generals office. She them want me to file a complaint at Consumer Relations at Mr.Cooper and gave me their phone and email. I was told my only option is to reinstate the loan to current. She wanted me to call her on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX to get the total amount to pay which will be valid only for 24 hours. There is nothing which she can do. 

Despite my every effort to resolve it, Mr. Cooper is finding ways to take my property as there is lot of equity in it. I was ready and willing to make payments at all times but they refused to take it. They refused to take payment in ec, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX so that they can tell that I am behind. I called numerous time to pay but they refused. When I inquire about the balance, it does not correspond to the balance which I see online. It seems all they want is my property. This is my only home for almost 18 years. I do not want to lose my property and they are trying to take it and snatch it. 

Please note that I am a sick patient and have recently survived XXXX. My body and my health will not allow me to handle the kind of stress which Mr. Cooper has put me and my family into. I have no other choice except to seek your help with the hope of getting it resolved. I need your help to relieve me of this painful stress and cheaters like Mr. Cooper. Looks like I am their new victim and they are the CONMAN. But I believe in justice.

Your help and assistance is deeply appreciated. Please help me. You are my only hope at this time. I cant sleep at nights. My stress level is extremely high due to this. My health keeps deteroiting. Please help me save my home for me and my family.

03/04/2019,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"I am filing this complaint after receiving a letter from Chase today alleging a lie to cover up their illegal activities. In the letter ( see attachment ) dated XX/XX/XXXX Chase asserted that we cant consider you for mortgage assistance because we didnt receive your initial request by the required number of days before the scheduled foreclosure date. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE. I REPEAT. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE, AND I CAN PROVE IT! 
Chase has repeatedly made false allegations like this to us for more than four years. Most of the Chase Request for Mortgage Assistance applications we have sent to Chase have been ignored ( see attachment ). Nonetheless, In XX/XX/XXXX, our Chase dedicated relationship manager in XXXX, Florida spoke to the Chase branch bank manager and vice president in XXXX, Georgia. He ( the vice president ) told her ( our dedicated relationship manager ) that he personally faxed all of our documents to her the previous week and confirmed their receipt in her office at that time. In spite of this fact, she requested through the branch bank vice president that we submit our application and all required documents to her again for the 33rd time in 18 months ( see attachment ). Consequently, our dedicated relationship manager sent to our home address a XXXX envelope for us to submit our application and documents back to her again. We sealed the documents in that envelope and took it back to the Chase branch bank so that Chase employees could send it to her through XXXX. 
The Chase branch bank in XXXX, Georgia took receipt of our envelope of documents and gave them to XXXX. XXXX tracking confirms that our application was received by our dedicated relationship manager in her actual office on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( see attachment ). After that date, we never heard from our dedicated relationship manager again regarding ANY aspect of our application. 
Chase proceeded in XXXX to schedule a foreclosure on our property for XX/XX/XXXX in violation of the laws of our state for multiple reasons, including failure to provide proper notification as required by law. As such, this proves the statement made by Chase to us in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX is a lie because we submitted our Request for Mortgage Assistance application to Chase more than thirty days before Chase took illegal action to attempt a foreclosure on the date of XX/XX/XXXX. Our "" dedicated relationship manager '' failed to process our application despite our having previously submitted it to her in XX/XX/XXXX, and well as on 32 previous occasions in the past 18 months.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,GA,305XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,03/04/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3169014

This is where I run in to problems.

According to Upstart there are 3 ways to add my new bank account. First, through logging in with my banks username and PW on their site. Unfortunately, since my bank is a small bank Upstart 's system is not compatible. Second, by uploading a check. I don't used checks and have none associated with this account. Third, 'small deposit method. ' This is where I enter my routing/account number, they place small deposits in my account, and I confirm. Because the first two options don't work for me, I chose this. However, there is a glitch in THEIR system. No matter how many times I enter my info I get an error message. They have acknowledged that this third method does not work. I only have the first two options, which for the reasons stated above, do not work for me.

I call and ask them to add my account manually. They say this is impossible. I find that ridiculous. First off, it is not this difficult to add bank accounts from any other major creditor. I believe this company is intentionally making this difficult. My current account will close next month and I will literally have no way to make a payment on my account. I am ready, willing, and able to make payments. They won't let me. Then, of course, they will report late payments to my credit and charge me more fees. This is outrageous.

03/04/2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"I recently opened an account with Santander, experienced some fraudulent activity through no fault of my own, and had my account closed. Communication throughout the entire experience was terrible, and {$5.00} of my money was never returned to me. 

Back in XXXX, I received mail offering a {$400.00} dollar bonus if I opened a Santander checking account. I'd had some bad experiences with other banks, and was eyeing Santander anyhow, so I decided to give it a try. On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a checking and savings account in branch. I had plans to open a business account as well, but was leaving for XXXX for two weeks, so decided to do that upon return. 

When I returned on theXX/XX/XXXX, I created an online account in order to transfer some money in and then set up direct deposit. I immediately noticed fraudulent activity which had occurred between the XXXX and XXXX. Someone had apparently deposited a bad check and withdrawn money from the ATM. Presumably they got ahold of my new ATM card somehow - it never arrived in the mail. As I had a mail hold from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, this would have had to be at the post office or at Santander itself. I called Santander to report this. They froze the account, saying I would receive results of the investigation in the mail. I eventually received a letter stating that the fraudulent charges were reversed. 

After the holidays, I called in to see if I could get another ATM card. After a lot of waiting, I was told that the whole account was now determined to be a fraud risk, but if I went to a bank I could close it and reopen. I was also told that the {$5.00} returned item fee from the bad check would be refunded. Upon going to the bank and attempting to do so, I was told that Santander would not allow me to open another account, and would in fact not refund that fee. I did leave with a check with my other money, but with quite a bad taste in my mouth. The banker was great, but it sounded like the person on the other end of the phone was telling him the bad news.

This fraud was very clearly not my fault, yet I was punished for it. I probably wouldn't have written this letter were it not for the {$5.00}. It's not a lot of money, but it's the principal of the matter - there is no reason Santander should not have given it back to me. The reasoning behind not restoring my account is also very suspect.

I have been disputing an entry on my credit report listing a Bankruptcy Chapter XXXX- discharged on XX/XX/XXXX for over a year. 
As proven in the documents I am attaching, there is no way the bankruptcy is validated as the Bankruptcy Courts do not verify them ( see attached letter ), it is not listed on my XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) report ( see attached report ), nor is there a bankruptcy reported on my XXXX report ( see attached report ). To quote the reply from my 1st complaint ( see attached response to my 1st complaint ) Equifax is a repository of credit information which has been supplied by creditors, collection agencies and public record holders. As such, we do not collect or maintain copies of contracts between consumers and their creditors. The disputed Discharged Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy # XXXX is currently reporting as discharged. The only other way it could possibly be reported is through PACER. I have previously requested ( see letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ), and I WILL DO SO AGAIN NOW, Equifax provide identifying info of the clerk they spoke to verifying the Bankruptcy as BK Rule 9037 states- "" PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION DEFINED AS INDIVIDUALS SOCIAL SECURITY & TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS, NAMES OF MINOR CHILDREN, LAST FOUR DIGITS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNT NUMBERS, AND DATE OF BIRTH, BE REDACTED FROM DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE COURT. '' Therefore obtaining verification through a subscription to PACER or any other agency is not only a violation of FCRA Section 611 ( a ) ( 2 ) which requires "" you to notify the party who furnished the disputed information '', Equifax would also be in violation of Section 5 ( a ) of the Federal Trade Commission Act ( FTC Act ) ( 15 USC 45 ) which prohibits "" unfair or deceptive acts or practices '' by purposely reporting information that they have "" assumed '' is verifiable based off circumstance.

Equifax has failed numerous times to provide me with a copy of any viable evidence, bearing my signature, showing the account is being reported accurately.

On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Westlake to get a payoff quote for refinance purposes with XXXX. I was at XXXX and had the loan specialist speak to Westlake representative ( rep ) and was told the payoff quote amount is $ XXXX.After being approved for the auto refinanced loan at XXXX, Westlake was again contacted to confirm exact mailing address for the payoff check to be mailed. Westlake/Rep stated to be sure to add the per diem expense for the days in the mail to the payoff amount or the check will be insufficient funds. A cashier check dated XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$7200.00} was sent to Westlake for my auto loan payoff. On Thursday XX/XX/XXXXI contacted Westlake after receiving a bill for past-due payments owed for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX car payments.

Westlake/XXXX  stated the fees and dues may still apply, but if we ( Westlake ) at fault and got lost in mail it will be waived and not charged to your account and Westlake will honor the original cashier check {$7200.00} as payoff I have to go.

I bought a mattress from XXXX XXXX  in XXXX  XXXX, VA in XX/XX/XXXX and used financing through Wells Fargo to pay it off in installments. Shortly after that, military obligations caused me to move to XXXX XXXX, CA. I had trouble getting auto payments set up after getting calls and calling Wells Fargo several times. I would get calls that the payment was due, I would pay it, and then ask why auto pay was not taking out the payments. After a few months of this happening, I then ended up deploying. When I returned the account had gone to collections and also been charged off. I received no emails about any of this happening. I then settled the entire account balance with Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX. My credit score had been increasing, due to no other negative remarks, and so I decided to send Wells Fargo a letter asking for a possible goodwill adjustment. The request was declined, but then I noticed that I had taken another big hit to my credit score. When I looked, Wells Fargo had updated the date reported on my account to XX/XX/XXXX. I'm not sure if they have the right to do this, but it seems unfair that an old debt could come back and negatively affect me well after it's been paid off and settled. I would just like some clarification as Wells Fargo has been unwilling to help me or give me answers. Thank you very much!

This week my score went from XXXX down to XXXX doing nothing wrong. I have paid my bills on time, and because of using two credit cards with under XXXX for XXXX ( XXXX kids ), they are reporting me as having lower credit score when checking on purchasing a car. 

So I went in and looked. As a XXXX  almost a XXXX, I am appauled at this game and plan on creating a petition to shut this all down. My credit is impecable and yet we are able to give you a low score for something that was years ago that wasn't ours at all. In XX/XX/2015 we purhased an edger from XXXX. ( nothing on my charge from XXXX ), so we put it on the charge. The edger didn't work day one so we called and returned it. Now months later years later centuries later I am still seeing this on my reports across the board even though it was never our fault never our debt. 

2 XXXX XXXX  placed our mortgage as late. They never had a late payment other than they told us to hold a payment for the HARP program ( I have the application documentation that was sent to them ). Then, they told us they lost the application. We then made the payment after sending them two applications to lower our house payment. We also always paid extra on principal again they are showing us to finish this loan as originally scheduled. They also forgot to lock our loan in when getting it. It was 3 % and we requested that day locked in. The next day we called ( the day the loan was locked ), and they said we are sorry we forgot to lock it in. So they charged us for all of these years almost 5 % on a loan that should have been 2 % less. Then when they sold the loan again they stated they do not have any of our payment history. I will be contacted a lawyer and filing a law suit against this bank. They are the most unethical bank I have ever touched or came across. Some guy calls and states how can we help and plays XXXX  from their corporate office. He knows exactly what he is doing. HARP never happened and our interest is way above what it should be and the XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX is reporting us late. What is going on in this country. 

3. XXXX XXXX  was hooked to a XXXX or XXXX ( I can't remember it's been so long ago ) and the card would auto grab purchases through their system. We had no idea some of these things were being charged to this so called background card. Then we could never find the card online to pay or to make things right. We finally did find the information on this card and suggeted they make a simple pay button and some kind of receipt so people know it didn't go on our visa debit rather on their card. It's when they first offered this and again we paid from their XXXX. It's fine to learn as you go, but not okay to make customers pay for the banks and lenders errors. I will be starting a petition to benefit all of us paying the bills to have these offices run. We need to go back to good old fashioned "" I know you and can trust you '' If not move along. This is getting to be a number nightmare. 

These three things were not on my report and boom as soon as we looked at a vehicle that I need to do my job, boom I have poor credit. I can keep my car it runs find, just getting to where I was thinking it was time. My current XXXX XXXX is running amazingly well so I guess the car company looses for the 7 % I will never pay for an auto loan. This happened in one day by looking. I will be calling my credit union to check on the original interest rate we had already been given. I hope people are placed in jail for fraud with these credit reporting problems.

( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file.

( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,330XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/03/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3168098

03/03/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Didn't receive advertised or promotional terms,"This complaint is with regard to two credit cards I was approved for by American Express - both for which I did not receive the promotion advertised after false communications by their representatives and misleading online application experiences. The two cards include the AmEx Everyday Preferred Card and The Platinum Card : *****On or about XX/XX/2018, I called American Express customer service to obtain information about my then existing accounts. While on the call, the representative stated that I was eligible for an upgrade offer ( upgrading from the no annual fee AmEx Everyday card to the annual fee AmEx Everyday Preferred card ). The offer was that I would receive XXXX Membership Reward points after spending {$2000.00} within 3 months of upgrading. I accepted the offer. 

6-8 weeks later, I called customer service to find out how much more I had left to spend to meet the spend requirement and was told that there was no record of the upgrade offer in my account. The representative submitted an inquiry and requested a recording of the call to confirm the upgrade offer. 

After multiple calls, trying to get confirmation of the offer, I finally received a notification stating that, because I did not have an RSVP number, I was not entitled to the offer. This notification was received on XX/XX/2018. At that point, I decided to discontinue using the card until the issue regarding the bonus was resolved as it made no sense to continue trying to meet a spend requirement for a bonus that I was, according to American Express, ineligible for. 

I filed a complaint with the XXXX and ultimately received a letter from American Express stating that I was in fact eligible for the offer. I received that letter on XX/XX/2018. In that letter, they mentioned, "" It is important to note, you have until XX/XX/2018, to meet the remaining spend for the promotional bonus ''. Thus, American Express notified me that I was eligible for the bonus a day after the bonus expired. 

The misleading communications by American Express led to a great deal of confusion about whether I was eligible for an upgrade offer. They advertised the offer with the promise of XXXX points after meeting spend requirements, and that was the reason why I decided to upgrade the card and pay the annual fee. ***** On or about XX/XX/2018, I was approved for The Platinum Card from American Express Exclusively for XXXX XXXX. The welcome offer for that card was XXXX Membership Rewards points after spending {$5000.00} in 3 months. I received email notification of approval, received the card in the mail, and spent over {$5000.00} in 3 months on the card, to ensure I would receive the bonus. 

On a customer service call with American Express, I learned that they would not be granting me the XXXX points because I "" have open and closed too many accounts with American Express ''. At no point was I informed that previously opening/closing accounts ( which, to my knowledge, I've only done twice over the course of several years ) would prevent me from obtaining the bonus - not during the application process, not when I was approved for the card, and not at any point while I was spending on the card. 

It is misleading to consumers to advertise that you can earn a certain amount of points after meeting spending requirements, and then, after they meet those requirements, say that they are not eligible for the points.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,TX,787XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/03/2019,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3167713

The most recent payment was removed from my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. There has never been any problem with my monthly payments. Funds have been available every month, and all payments have been processed as agreed. My records show that this agreement is in effect until XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I began receiving emails stating that my account was unpaid and overdue as of XX/XX/XXXX, despite the fact that Discover was still removing {$370.00} from my bank account every month. This email harassment has continued almost daily. My phone is showing 30 missed calls from ( XXXX ) XXXX, which is more than ridiculous. I have called Discover,  and was told that I did not have any sort of payment agreement with them. If that is the case, how are they still taking money out of my credit union account every month? I have also sent messages several times per week via their online message center. I have received only generic replies. My online account center shows that the payments have all been made, and my bank statements also prove this. 
I am fed up with this harassment. Discover has failed to correct their error, and I am sick and tired of trying to resolve this matter with them. Their pat response is, Well, you need to call a different number so one of our account specialists can help you. That number is already unattended by the time I get home from work. I am not wasting any more of my time on these incompetent morons. They have had every opportunity to resolve this matter, and have failed to do so. My account is NOT overdue. My payments have been made every month as agreed. I have never agreed to any change in terms or due date, nor have I been advised of any status change regarding my automatic payments.

I am requesting an investigation to determine why my payments are not being acknowledged and/or credited to my account. Im sure Im not the only person who is experiencing this type of unnecessary harassment from Discover Student Loans. This should be a very simple matter to resolve, yet Discover has refused to do so.

03/02/2019,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I believe Great Lakes intentionally misapplied my monthly payment. 
I have XXXX XXXX Loans. I XXXX Tokens/Loan types. I am currently signed up on an extended level monthly plan of {$870.00}. The {$870.00} payment I make each month is more than the amount of interest that the accounts accrue and thus, should cover the principal accrued for each month, with some left to go to principal. 

It was my belief that the {$870.00} would be applied among the XXXX tokens, with the amount first going to each token 's monthly accrued interest and any excess towards the principals. 

On XX/XX/2019, I made my {$870.00} payment for the month of XX/XX/2019. However, when I reviewed how my payment was allocated on my online account, I saw that Great Lakes did not allocate it properly to Token XXXX. I owed at that point in time about {$22000.00} on Token XXXX. From XX/XX/2019 to XX/XX/2019, I accrued {$130.00} of interest on Token XXXX. Yet, of my {$870.00} monthly payment, only {$18.00} went to Token XXXX. That left {$120.00} of unpaid interest on Token XXXX. Great Lakes reallocated the remaining {$850.00} towards the other XXXX tokens, and applied {$450.00} of it to Token XXXX, although that token had only accrued about {$220.00} in interest that month. 

I am very concerned that Great Lakes is not allocating my payment to cover all the monthly interest accrued on Token XXXX. As stated in the beginning, my monthly payment of {$870.00} is more than enough to cover the interest accrued monthly on all XXXX tokens. It is also my understanding that my monthly payment would cover the interest accrued monthly on all XXXX loans. I am confused and perplexed as to why Great Lakes would not apply my payment to cover the interest accrued for Token XXXX. I am concerned going forward, because if they are not applying my monthly payments are not going towards all the monthly interest accrued for Token XXXX, then that interest will accumulate and it will be harder to pay it down in the future. 

It is my belief that Great Lakes intentionally misapplied my payment. On XX/XX/2019, I made a second monthly payment of {$5000.00}. The second {$5000.00} payment was suppose to go straight to the principal of XXXX XXXX. 
It was my intent to pay {$870.00} as my monthly payment ; the {$870.00} would cover the monthly interest accrued for all XXXX tokens, including the {$130.00} of accrued interest on Token XXXX. Afterwards, I was going to make a second payment of {$5000.00} to that would fully go straight to the principal of Token XXXX. I was allowed to do that as long as I made my required payment of {$870.00}. 

Instead of applying my monthly payment of {$870.00} to all the interest accrued on the XXXX tokens and then applying the full {$5000.00} to the principal of Token XXXX, Great Lakes applied only {$18.00} of the {$870.00} to Token XXXX. 

It then used {$120.00} of the {$5000.00} to pay the remaining monthly accrued interest of Token XXXX, and then the remaining {$4800.00} went to the principal of Token XXXX. 

I believe Great Lakes is doing this because it is intentionally trying to delay me from paying down my principal.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,GREAT LAKES,FL,341XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/02/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3167584

She read all four ( 4 ) of my cell phone number 's I have with XXXX XXXX XXXX and said it's for the cell phones I have ( she also had my home address ). I told her I still have my cell phones and I have been paying XXXX XXXX XXXX monthly for them in cell phone charges, taxes etc. The young lady I was speaking to said she would transfer me to her supervisor and I explained the same thing to him. He then said ok, this is what we can do ... we will lower the balance you owe of {$510.00}. I told him that I would like to speak to XXXX XXXX XXXX and I also asked him to mail me something in writing. He said ok let me get them online and we'll do a 3 way call. He did call XXXX XXXX XXXX and it was a recording saying they will be right with us momentarily. However, we were on hold for a while so he said that they would call me back tomorrow. And I said ok. In the meantime, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX myself, I was able to get through, I spoke to a customer service representative and explained that a company was trying to say I owe {$510.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX checked my account and said I have a {$0.00} balance. They said that the next time I speak to Credence I can advise them to call XXXX XXXX XXXX and I agreed. The next few days Credence called my cell phone numerous times, I would answer and I didn't hear anyone on the other end, once I said hello they would hang up. This went on for a while, sometimes I would just ignore the call and would not answer. Today, XX/XX/2019 I received a call from them again, I answered and no one was on the other end. This time I called them right back and right away a man answered. He had my name, cell number and even verified my home address, I confirmed. He told me about the amount I owed and I told him that I've spoke to them a couple weeks ago and that I have even spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX and that I do not owe {$510.00}. I explained to the man that usually when your account goes to collection that a bill would come first from the company which would be XXXX XXXX XXXX trying to collect the amount, then if I didn't pay they would send to collections. I told the man that I have not received a bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX ever for {$510.00}. And furthermore, I had contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and they said I have a {$0.00} balance. The man continued to say that I owe XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I told him that I did not have a {$510.00} balance with XXXX XXXX XXXX, I also said they should call XXXX XXXX XXXX themselves to verify I have a {$0.00} balance, I then went on to say that I still have my phones, that I pay monthly for cell phone charges and I thought that they are a fraud company and I wanted them to please remove my cell phone number from their list, because I get a call everyday from their company. The man said ok I'll remove your number from our list then and he hung up. That was the end of our conversation.",,"Credence Resource Management, LLC",CA,913XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,03/07/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3167294

03/02/2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"I recently had an opportunity to due business with Gateway at a location in XXXX Kansas. Unfortunately this did not end well and legal action might need to be pursued. I have filed a complaint with the Kansas Officer of the State Banking Commissioner and with the Kansas Attorney General. I have tried many times to get in contact with this location ( XXXX XXXX ) as well as his regional manager XXXX XXXX to no avail. I have left messages and sent emails and no one has responded. I am submitting this complaint with the expectation this can be worked out and we can reach an agreement to suit both sides. If not I will have no choice but to seek legal council and pursue this matter through the legal system. The more the public finds out the more other applicants may question the outcome of their loan decisions. 

I submitted an application with Gateway on XX/XX/XXXX. I was assigned to XXXX XXXX ( Branch Manager ). He asked for paystubs, tax returns, w2 's and such to prequalify us for a home we had a contract on. I uploaded all this information into their system on XX/XX/XXXX. We were notified we were prequalified. On XX/XX/XXXX we had a contract on a HUD REO home. They said they began working on the loan on XX/XX/XXXX even though they were given copies of the contract on XX/XX/XXXX. They ordered us to get a structural inspection, estimates for repairs, estimates for appliances, as well as resubmitting all the pay stubs, w2, and tax returns and such. We struggled back and forth with them because the items they were asking for did not line up with the FHA guidelines we were reading and so we questioned them. Every time we did they would come back with the same response. It is a Gateway requirement. As it was getting time to set a closing date they sent an email to us letting us know we would be required to put up money in an escrow for repairs. We began to question this and was asking why it was not going to be rolled into the loan. We further more was asking for a detailed explanation of how this was going to work so we could ensure we would get our money back because we needed it for other items. Then I sent an email that stated I had done some research on their company and how I discovered they had lost their license in other states, been banned in Georgia, and fined in many other states for fraud and I was just wanting reassurance we were okay. I sent this email to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I also sent one to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a message from XXXX XXXX that we were headed back to underwriting for clear to close which we were trying to do on XX/XX/XXXX. Then all of a sudden on XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX XXXX that they had "" missed the 6 month on job '' requirement for FHA. That I could go conventional if I wanted. I asked him to run the numbers and let me know that we could do that. I wanted this house. This house was not an easy home to replace. The price and amount of land it had does not happen in this market. I had 6 weeks and money invested in it. Then on XX/XX/XXXX he sends me an email that states he looked at it they were higher and he doesn't think we would want to do it. I then sent an email asking for the numbers so I could make the decision and I never heard anything back. I qualified for and had the down payment for a conventional loan. I was not given the opportunity to pursue a conventional loan nor was I given a reason as to why I could not. It was not XXXX XXXX 's place to make the decision for me as to whether or not I would want to do it or not. It was MINE. 

I believe this sudden interest in getting rid of me was because of my questioning the validity of some of their actions as well as my research into the company. I was retaliated and discriminated against because I was seeking the truth. Not only did I lose the house I wanted and invested money in I now am incurring more expenses while I find another home to purchase. All of the people involved deal with loans all day long. They did not "" miss '' this requirement they just wanted me gone. 

XXXX sent me an email over a month ago stating I would be reimbursed for the XXXX XXXX ( {$350.00} ) and I have not received any compensation. I am also seeking compensation for the unnecessary expenses I have incurred because of the disregard for my interest.",,GATEWAY FIRST BANK,KS,,,Consent provided,Web,03/02/2019,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3167598

I checked my account on XX/XX/XXXX as I was doing my monthly bills and I saw a message that my card had been cancelled. I called Citi the same day.

I also never received any indication from my bank account of a returned item due to not having proper funds in my account to pay my bill to XXXX. I only found my original payments were not posted when I logged into my online XXXX account. I immediately paid my bill with my debit card and confirmed with my bank the following day to ensure the payments had successfully been transferred to XXXX. 

I'm only bringing this issue to the attention of others now because I did not know XXXX was reporting any of these payments as late to credit reporting agencies until I reviewed my credit report earlier this year. I have been negatively impacted when trying to apply for other forms of credit for almost 6 years due to late payments on my record caused by XXXX. Since these late payments are not the result of my wrongdoing, and due to the circumstances listed above, I respectfully request for XXXX  to remove the late payments during the months of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. Please consider my track record of on-time payments as proof I take my financial obligations seriously.

I always pay this account in full and had received bills and paid them online. The clothes arrived and I paid the account in full. There was a backordered item, but I thought I had paid for it when I paid the account in full. The backordered item arrived many months later and when it did it said my credit card had been charged the amount of the backordered product. 

I logged on to the account and paid the amount, but it was one day late. I called and talked to the agent who said they would forgive any fees based on the circumstances with the backorder. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I began to receive calls from XXXX XXXX asking me to call. I did. I was told that the account was past due which surprised me. They had charged me the late payment fee even though they said they would not in earlier conversations and because I thought the account was PIF I had not checked it. There were a couple of late payment fees on there as a result! I explained the situation again to the agent, she removed the fees and told me if I paid {$18.00} it would resolve the issue. I had now basically paid twice for the item I ordered but I went ahead and paid it just to resolve the issue. I also asked that I now receive a paper bill because I did not trust them to do what they said from the original conversation about the backordered product and removal of the original fee. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I come home from work and the XXXX credit card statement is in the mail and I have a {$75.00} balance!! I immediately called and relayed to the agent the situation and that I was told on XX/XX/XXXX this was result and the account was PIF. They said they had record of the {$18.00} payment but the fees had not been removed and so I had received another late fee on XXXX, when I thought the account was PIF!! I asked to talk to a supervisor who said they could remove the most current late fee but not all the other charges, so I would owe {$55.00}, all of fees that I was told twice would be waived He said they had a one waiver policy and I could use it here. I told him, I had been told twice already fees were waived and I didn't trust them to do so and I would not pay for fees that I was told by the Comenity had been waive two times previously. He refused to do anything for me and when I told him I was going to the CFPB he then revoked the offer to waive the fee!! I then asked to cancel the account which he did for me. 

I believe this is a scam by XXXX and that they are engaging in dishonest practices. I always pay my bills in full, I have excellent credit. I also believe they retaliated against me for raising a claim with the CFPB.",,Alliance Data Card Services,PA,,,Consent provided,Web,03/05/2019,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3167395

Second, I also understand the law to state that if there is any incorrect information listed on my credit report, the debt collect must, by law, correct the incorrect information.

03/02/2019,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"When I opened my savings and checking accounts, I specifically requested Santander Bank to not allow overdrafts in my accounts ; i.e. decline transactions that would result in an overdraft, if I did not have enough money in my accounts ( I am attaching a letter sent to me by Santander Bank that proves my request ). I requested this because I not always pay too much attention to how much money I have in my accounts. Selecting this option gave me peace of mind since I knew that if I wanted to pay for something but I didnt have enough money, Santander Bank would just decline the transaction and I would know I was running low on my balance. 

Beginning on XX/XX/XXXXsome payments using my savings account were not only not declined, but a ridiculous number of overdraft fees were charged to my account. I didnt notice anything because I didnt receive any text message or email alerting me of the situation. In addition, I changed my address and I received the first forwarded overdraft notice by the beginning of XX/XX/. However, by that time my mother ( another Santander Bank client ) and I had already contacted several times the bank trying to settle this issue.

Not only Santander Bank did not decline the transactions ( none of them were recurring payments, therefore, they should have been declined due to lack of funds in my account ) but also it began to record ( on XX/XX/2019 and on ) some doubtful transactions, none of which I was aware of. For instance, the same amount charged twice the same day ( charging me two overdrafts fees! ) and then, the following day recording something as ACH RETURNED ITEM twice, which resulted in me being charged two overdrafts fees AGAIN! 

We ( my mother and I ) have called XXXX times Santander Bank ( from XX/XX/ to XX/XX/2019; we have dates, names, hours of calls, etc. ) and we have been told every time that a supervisor is going to call us back, but no one has done so. At the middle of XXXX, we noticed that not only Santander Bank did not resolve my issue, but they actually closed my account and sent it to collections. 

To summarize, there are five ( 5 ) overdraft fees that should have not been charged to me ( 35*5= {$170.00} ). In addition, my credit report might have been affected negatively because of this issue. I exhausted every possibility to resolve this issue directly with Santander Bank and I have no other option, but to make a formal complaint against the bank. Santander Bank is not only charging me fees that it is not authorized to charge, but it is blindingly ignoring any and all of my attempts to resolve this issue. I request Santander Bank to write off those five ( 5 ) overdraft fees and to correct any bad report submitted to consumer credit reporting agencies, in case the bank had made a bad report against me.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"SANTANDER BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",NJ,,,Consent provided,Web,03/03/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3167712

03/02/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with balance transfer,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a balance transfer in the amount of {$12000.00} from my Discover card to my XXXX-XXXX card. This request was done electronically. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the amount of {$12000.00} was received by XXXX-XXXX and applied to my account. 

However, on XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that the Discover balance of {$12.00}, XXXXstill remained, so I contacted Discover to see what the hold-up was. At that point, Discover said that they had NOT received any payment from XXXX-XXXX and requested that I set up an automatic payment with them so I would not miss a future payment. I did this as not to mess with my credit score and in hopes that this would be cleared up soon. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Discover billed me for {$500.00} On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Discover. XXXX put me on hold to review my account, and then transferred me to another department. XXXX then told me that Discover had not received a payment from XXXX-XXXX, and requested that I contact XXXX-XXXX to initiate an investigation into what happened. 

That same day, I contacted XXXX-XXXX. The woman that I spoje with, XXXX, said that the money had to be received by someone and that they would have a resolution for me within 30 days. I was then transferred to another department where I spoke to XXXX who also told me that XXXX-XXXX would investigate where the money went and I would be notified via paper mail. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I recevied a letter from XXXX-XXXX cardmember services stating that the transfer I initiated back in XX/XX/XXXX was applied to my Discover account on XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$12.00}, XXXX ( letter uploaded here ). 

Because there had been no resolution, I began paying DOUBLE - money to Discover and money to XXXX-XXXX - to avoid falling into bad credit. 

Thus, on XX/XX/XXXX, My Discover balance was {$12.00}, XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contact Discover yet AGAIN. I began speaking with XXXX who put me on hold to talk with various departments. I was eventually transferred to XXXX who opened a missing payment case on my behalf. She said that they would have results for me in 15 days, and would reach out to XXXX-XXXX. In the interim, she provided me with a case number and requested that I send the letter XXXX-XXXX sent me on XX/XX/XXXX to Discover 's Payment Research Department. This is did in good faith. She also indicated that a credit would be applied to my account while this issue was being resolved. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX-XXXX  again and spoke with XXXX and then XXXX. Discover wanted additional information on how the money was sent from XXXX-XXXX  to Discover, so I was inquiring about that. XXXX was able to tell me that the money was sent to Discover as a check on XX/XX/XXXX. He provided me with the chek number, the routing number, and the account number. I then called Discover and spoke with XXXX, who I shared the above information with. 

Unfortunately, this information was not good enough for Discover. From my point of view, I have bent over backwards trying to provide information to them regarding this balance transfer. It has caused me nothing but stress and anxiety and yest Discover is the one continuing to benefit from this. Discover reached out vial email ( I have never received a phone call from them ) which stated that the information ( check number, rounting number, etc. ) was not enough and that they needed to see a cleared copy ( front and back ) of the check that was sent from XXXX-XXXX  to Discover. 

So ... once again, on XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX-XXXX. I spoke with XXXX, who said that he would be requesting a copy of the cleared check and have it mailed to me within 7 business days. 

On XXXX, I received an email from Discover stating that since they had not heard back from me, they are assuming that I have taken care of this on my own, and will be returning the balance to my Discover card. 

It is now XXXX, and I have yet to receive any information from XXXX-XXXX. 

I am sick of this run around. I have done my due dilligence, contacting each company month after month since XX/XX/XXXX.  Here it is, almost 6 months later, and not only am I paying off one credit card ... I am paying the same amount on a card that was transferred.

So at this point my bank told me I can not reopen this case and that I have to take it up with the merchant which they FINALLY provided me contact info for. 

I called the merchant and I was connected to a third-party phone company that handles calls for smaller businesses. They were able to provide me with a tracking number and a confirmation that my account was canceled as soon as the charge-back went through. There was no notation that the company attempted to dispute the charge-back, and the man on the phone was not able to provide me with contact info for the actual company. What can I do at this point? I understand that it is only ~ {$90.00}, but I am a XXXX XXXX and I really need that money for living expenses. The tracking number wasn't even shipped to the correct address so the product that I supposedly ordered was never delivered, and it was returned to sender even though the confirmation email I received contained my correct address and the bank verified my address as well. The bank told me to "" figure it out with the merchant '' even though I literally can not speak to the merchant or receive any useful information from the third-party operator. And I'm out XXXX {$90.00} that I desperately need. They failed to note my info down correctly which has caused this to happen, and it caused them to have incorrect information on the supposed single chance they have. I have given my time and resources to prove that I did not make these charges, and I don't know what else I can do. Thank you for your help.

03/01/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"On XX/XX/, 2019 I had received a notification my credit score had gone down which I am in the process of purchasing a home and can not have it go down, so I logged online to see the reason it had gone down and the notification stated I had one of my credit cards maxed out to be specific my JCPenny Store Credit Card maxed out. I was confused and thought to myself this is clearly fraud because I dont have my JCPenny Credit Card maxed out and the notification continued to say make a payment and bring the balance down to bring your credit score back up. I immediately called JCPenny customer service XXXX at XXXX central standard time on XX/XX/, 2019. I explain to the customer service representative that it shows me maxed out on my credit card and this is wrong and clearly fraud and she stated it was correct that they changed my credit limit to {$280.00}. I asked her on what grounds did they change it and this is deceptive business practices because they did not inform me that they had changed it or why, that I received not notification whatsoever. I told her that as a consumer who agreed to a certain amount when I initially applied for the card a year ago and allowed them to run my credit a year ago and was approved for {$500.00} that this has been my a credit amount this entire time. I told her I have never paid late or gone over my credit limit. The representative said that is correct you were approved for {$500.00} about a year ago and never paid late and said however we have a system that monitors your spending habits and will match your credit line to your spending habits, so I tell the representative okay let me make sense of what you are saying and said since I dont max out my card or use the {$500.00} every month your system is monitoring my spending habits and your system changed my credit limit to match my actual spending amount and she said yes. I tell the representative again this is deceptive business practices to monitor my spending or any consumers spending and based on those grounds they changed my credit limit and thats where I have an issue because it was changed without my knowledge and this hurt my credit score. I told her because you monitored my spending and changed my limit to what I actually spend which is roughly {$280.00} a month and me having a balance of {$270.00} has a negative impact on me and this information reports to credit bureau as a card maxed out and to make a payment to bring balance down and this would then raise your credit score and thats where I have a problem and issue with these deceptive business practices. This company completed deceptive business practices by monitoring my spending but to change my credit limit based on spending habits and not inform the consumer is deceptive and wrong. The representative apologizes and says we can raise it again but to raise a credit limit we have to run your credit report again which I declined and told her why would I run my credit report again to have the same limit I initially started with. I told her I gave you permission to run it a year ago and agreed to a certain amount and for what for you to monitor my spending and just change it. I informed her I was gon na file a complaint because they did not notify me in any way, shape or form and if it was not because of my alert from credit bureaus that there had been a change to credit score I would never have known the amount changed. I told her I could have decided to purchase something for someone as a gift and my card would have been declined and again she apologizes and says lets run your credit score again to raise it back up for you.

I informed Wells Fargo employees that I WOULD NOT consent to signing a modification and advised them that my mother needed to refinance her property in order to remove me from her home loan. Wells Fargo employees instructed me to sign a Quit Claim Deed and advised me that I would be removed from the deed of my mother 's home and the loan ( deed of trust ) for my mother 's residence ( above referenced property ). I signed a Quit Claim Deed in XXXX. I learned in XX/XX/XXXX that Wells Fargo actually modified my mother 's original loan without my knowledge, consent, or signature in XXXX. I was not aware of any of this until XX/XX/XXXX and have never received any documentation pertaining to the loan on my mother 's residence. I have been a homeowner since XXXX and have not lived at my mother 's residence since about XXXX. After repeatedly questioning them, I learned that Wells Fargo employees instructed me to sign a Quit Claim Deed in XXXX because that actually ONLY removed me from the deed and NOT the deed of trust. Since I adamantly REFUSED to sign a loan modification in reference to the property listed above in XXXX, Wells Fargo employees used deceitful tactics to have me removed from the deed of the property. Wells Fargo then processed a loan modification without my knowledge in XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo employees acted as if they had a document with my signature on it from XXXX. I informed them several times that my signature was forged if they have any modification document from XXXX containing my signature. I later learned that they DID NOT have modification paperwork from XXXX containing my signature. I was informed in XX/XX/XXXX by Wells Fargo employees that "" they were not required to have my signature on the loan modification in XXXX. '' I repeatedly advised that this was illegal. I was informed that this practice was "" ok '' back in XXXX but advised that this practice "" has since changed '' and that they require signatures from everyone listed on the loan.

03/01/2019,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"LoanCare in XXXX  XXXX, a loan company and collection agency, bought the paper for my mortgage. I became one month late when I tried to change companies after a problem with them demanding I pay taxes. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX veteran and do not pay taxes. I paid the delinquent month last summer. However, the money was not applied to my mortgage and the only answer I could get from them was that it went to fees. 

Now, seven months later and with a poor credit rating, I was finally told that last summer my monthly payment was increased by {$37.00} which I was never told. And, LoanCare does not accept partial payments. So, they put my mortgage payment into a Suspense Acct and began using it to pay late fees. I was never told it was a partial payment. I would have happily sent them the additional {$37.00}. 

I believe this is a deceptive business practice from a loan and collection company to collect additional monies. Now, my credit rating is too poor to change to an ethical mortgage company. Also, although I am now current, LoanCare is telling me I owe more than {$300.00} for escrow. When I spoke with a representative last XX/XX/XXXX, he said I was {$130.00} short in escrow. So, I sent them the {$130.00}. I am in great hopes you will investigate this company and take the appropriate action to deny them the ability to purchase mortgages from XXXX veterans on fixed incomes. Thank you.

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email with a survey to rate my experience. Confused, I called the hotline only to be told my claim had been denied which I had not been notified of. When I asked why, I was told the items were not the same. After speaking to the rep, at her request- I provided additional pictures of the bag. I was told an adjuster would call me within 2 business days. I asked that this person to call during evening hours. However, he did not and I missed his call. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX only to be told the whole claim needed to be restarted for an adjuster to see if. After this was done I waited almost 2 weeks before speaking to him. He informed me that it was denied because the items were different. I assured him they were not and he told me he would look into it. If I didn't head back from him it meant good news. If he did call back it was because he needed additional information. He told me a final decision would be reached in 48 hours. 

I waited 2 additional weeks for him to call back or for my claim to be updated. In the interim I called 5 different times and was told to give the adjuster time that the claim status was "" additional documents needed to be verified. '' Finally upset I called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to someone who appeared sympathetic to issue. After speaking to her manager only part of the claim was approved. When I asked why she gave me no reason. Instead she told me a manager would call me within 5 days. No one ever called. On XX/XX/XXXX I called again for an update and spoke to a rep who said I would have to resubmit the claim and that she would attach her notes so it would be approved. She confirmed with me and with a manager the items in question were indeed the same.

Being beyond frustrated and feeling helpless, our Attorney has confirmed the difficulty in any sincerity of OCWEN even as we make every effort in good faith, has cited several federal lawsuit filed as late as XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for this very unprofessional, unethical and illegal behavior towards Homeowners and has recommended that we contact CFPB immediately. 
Our goal is simple, to have OCWEN follow through in re-writing a loan with current, realistic, attainable and sustainable amounts and dues, follow through the initially extended immediate Principal Reduction, ( waiver of any Trial Period ), and forwarding us through our Attorney, new and updated documents to sign and return. 
We have been proactive with good intentions and followed through on requests in good faith. We want to save and stay in our home through what we know to be a fair resolution for all parties. However, we will not be treated by OCWEN in this unethical, illegal manner while they engage in Dual Tracking and now acceleration of foreclosure process to deny us the time and opportunity to allow them to first review and correct their own errors and us to continue to work towards our goal of maintaining our home. 
It is with this in mind that we reach out to you. 
Thank you.

03/01/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"To whom it may concern at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Here is the chronology of my transaction on account number : # # # # # # # # # # # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CitiBank On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I was visiting my daughter in XXXX XXXX. I was there to help her move there from XXXX to attend XXXX school. I was having her car serviced and I had time to kill so I went into the XXXX XXXX and purchased a XXXX XXXX purse that was reduced to {$14.00} and some odd dollars. I used my XXXX card to get additional savings and I believe that my bill came to approximately {$16.00} and some odd cents with tax. I generally pay my balance off immediately at the register with cash, so that I do not have a balance on my account, but for whatever reason on that day, I decided to pay it later. I never received a bill/statement in the mail, but when I was in downtown XXXX sometime in XX/XX/XXXX, I remembered that I need to pay for the purse that Id purchased in Indiana and I also needed to have my parking validated, so I used that opportunity to go in and pay my bill in person. The cashier pulled up my account by my social security number, gave me the balance that was due on the computer of {$16.00} and odd cents. I paid in cash. I believed at that time, my debt was paid in full and settled. 

Months go by and then I started getting a series of calls from XXXX XXXX. I dont have any nearby XXXX 's stores and I thought that it was just another solicitation since they did not leave messages, so I ignored the calls. When I blocked the XXXX 800 number, I received a call from XXXX and they left a message from their credit department. This was on XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately called them back at XXXX and spoke with a credit counselor for 13 minutes. I was shocked when she told me that I had a balance of {$150.00}. I was outraged that somehow a {$14.00} purse that I knew that I had paid for, had somehow grown into such an outrageous charge. I was driving when I spoke with the credit department and was therefore not able to take notes. She told me that when I paid my bill in person, it was paid late and that a {$2.00} charge was added. I was never informed of the additional amount when I paid the bill. That {$2.00} had now grown to {$150.00}. I explained that I had no way of knowing about the {$2.00} change and I would have gladly paid it when I paid the {$16.00}, if I had known about it. I was never informed by the customer service department that a {$2.00} fee had been added. I never received a bill. I was informed that when I moved, and I changed the address on my account, that only changed my account with XXXX, but not with their credit department. How is a consumer suppose to know this? The credit department still had my previous address at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on file. What they didnt know is that I still own that home and I rent it out. My tenant is a close personal friend who always passes along my mail, and I had not received any bills from XXXX during the disputed time period. I was livid about the situation and told the credit personal that I would be canceling my account and never shopping at XXXX again. She reduced one of the late charges and reduced the bill down to approximately {$120.00}. I was disgusted. I decided that I would go into my local XXXX directly and pay the amount in cash and close my account. I was driving so I was not in a position to take notes or conduct further business. 

I immediately went into the customer service counter at the XXXX XXXX  XXXX  to pay up and be done with the whole situation. My husband thought that I should not pay the amount on principal. He thought that we should have them send us to collections and fight it there. Quite frankly, the amount wasnt worth my time. I just wanted to put the situation behind me, never shop at XXXX again and tell everyone who would listen about this outrageous situation. I was once again prepared to pay the full amount in cash, I was told at the customer service counter that they could not close my account, that they were not authorized to do that. They told me to call the credit department back, that they were the only ones authorized to close my account and that I also might have better luck with a different credit counselor. 

I immediately went home and called back the credit department. I was now in a position to take notes. I spoke with XXXX, who gave me her ID number : XXXX. She agreed that if I had known that I owned the {$2.00} late fee, that I would have paid it at the time that I paid my bill in person. Common sense dictates that anyone who went to the trouble of paying the bill in person for such a small purchase, would have paid the full amount that was only approximately {$18.00} in total. XXXX said that she was authorized to reduce the charge from the {$120.00} and some odd cents down to {$81.00}. I of course wasnt happy about this con scheme by CitiBank for all of the charges on a {$2.00} late fee but what are you going to do? XXXX confirmed that the previous counselor that I had spoken with at XXXX had not made the billing address change, even though I had requested that it be changed to my current address at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA. XXXX could not provide me confirmation in writing that my account had been canceled because they were not set up to do so that her location. She gave me a confirmation of # XXXX and told me that I was now paid up in full. XXXX was sympathetic and told me that their policy was to add another {$2.00} charge to my bill because once again, I was paying late. I told her to add {$5.00} to what I way paying to avoid that. She told me that she could not authorize additional payment from her location. The only way to avoid another {$2.00} late fee was either to put my debit card on file for automatic payment, or to go into a store location and that they could authorize additional payments. There was no way that I way going to give CitiBank free access to my debit card, so I went into the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and paid {$5.00} so that I could cover any additional late fees. 

After all of that effort on my part, paying a bill that no ethical business would have charged me to begin with, I received a new account statement yesterday in the mail with a {$34.00} late fee. I will NOT be paying this bill. Evidently XXXX/CitiBank now believe that they can bill me in perpetuity for {$2.00} late fee on a {$14.00} purse.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,956XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/01/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3166920

Eight ( 8 ) days later, we received a notice in the mail from a 3rd party collection agency, Convergent Outsourcing , inc . I called XXXX about the notice and they confirmed the account was paid in full and there was no record of having turned it over to Convergent. XXXX stated that even though the account was closed, they weren't able to provide me with a receipt for the phone payment I made, or, any documentation to confirm closure of the account and suggested that I contact Convergent. The next day I called Convergent, and after being given four ( 4 ) different phone numbers to call within that agency with nobody finding a record of the notice they sent me, I finally was able to speak to someone who confirmed that the account was inactive, and there was no dept or balance due. However, they refused to send me judgement or verification of the dept, even though on the notice it states that if I contacted them within 30 days of receipt of the notice, a copy would be mailed to me. I spent 53 minutes on the phone and spoke with 5 different people including a supervisor to get to that point. As a consumer, I find it extremely troubling to be put in a vulnerable position of no written proof of closure, and having to rely on the same people who erroneously generated the dept collection notice to have competently resolved the issue.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Convergent Resources, Inc.",CA,922XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/01/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3166550

03/01/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I called JP Morgan Chase regarding my Private Mortgage Insurance in early XXXX. My mortgage was purchased by the entity in XXXX and I have been paying Private Mortgage Insurance since inception of the loan. During XXXX I realized we were very close to reaching the 80 % LTV thresh-hold required to get rid of our PMI and wanted to go ahead and pay down my principal to reach the magic thresh-hold. Our family had much more free cash available and getting rid of the approximately {$100.00} additional monthly payment seemed to make sense. 

When I called and asked if could pay down the additional principal I was told that even if I did that I would have to either ( 1 ) pay for an appraisal or ( 2 ) wait until XX/XX/XXXX and request a waiver of PMI. I decided that instead of forfeiting {$550.00} I would wait the additional year. Getting close to XX/XX/XXXX I called Chase and asked what steps I would have to take to remove my PMI. I was told that even though my LTV would dip below the 80 % thresh-hold this year I would still have to pay for an appraisal or wait until my LTV hit 78 % for the PMI to fall off. I was very thorough in my original dealings with chase and was told that once I hit 80 % I would not have to pay for an appraisal, rather I would just have to request the amount be waived. Had I been given accurate information in the beginning, I would have paid for the appraisal - saving me over {$2500.00} in PMI payments. I also was VERY thorough in my communications with chase and calculated every scenario giving them ample proof that my LTV was well within the requirements. This work on my end was ignored and their response was simply that I had to pay for an appraisal anyway. 

I am going to pay the appraisal - mainly because I'm tired of throwing away money when my account is obviously not a risk. I have never been late on any debt payment including my mortgage payments to Chase. Please see my communication with them below regarding why a waiver is applicable in my scenario. 

"" I would like to request a waiver of our monthly PMI payment. Our principal amount due {$130000.00} hits 79.93 percent of the original loan value {$170000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. At this point in time the amount due will only be 73.62 percent of our original appraised value {$190000.00}. The original appraisal was performed on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX, XXXX License # TX XXXX R. Our current value according to the XXXX County Appraisal District is {$220000.00}. Using this value as of XX/XX/XXXX our LTV will be 61.21 percent. The appraisal value from the district is publicly available via the XXXX County Appraisal District at XXXX XXXX XXXX. You can confirm this value easily by searching for our home. 

Other factors to consider when determining whether to waive the PMI amount include our current annual income of {$220000.00}, our high credit scores, and our history of timely payments both regarding our credit card with chase, our mortgage with chase, and any escrow shortages that hit our account. 

I will be happy to provide any documents required to process this request. 

I contacted chase in XXXX regarding removal of the PMI and at that time I was told I would have to receive an appraisal costing {$550.00} to remove the PMI OR I could wait until XX/XX/XXXX and fill out paperwork and the PMI would be waived at this point. I am now being told that I will have to pay an appraisal fee in XX/XX/XXXX, even though I confirmed with the original contact that this would not be the case. If I had been given clear information at the time of my first request I would have paid the {$550.00} and forewent the addition 12 months of PMI {$1100.00}. I am tired of dealing with the inadequate information Chase provides regarding the removal of this PMI. I understand that PMI is for protection of the lender, which is completely understandable, however, based on factors listed above I do not consider our account a risk and do not believe the insurance payment is necessary. Please accept this as my request for a waiver. ''",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TX,784XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/01/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3166823

03/01/2019,Debt collection,Auto debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to initiate complaint against First Investors Servicing Corporation ( First Investors ). The particulars are as follows below : I had a repossession that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX concerning my XXXX XXXX. Shortly thereafter, I entered an agreement with Mr. XXXX XXXX, a representative at First Investors Servicing Corporation where the stipulated agreement was for {$8000.00} and monthly payments were to be {$150.00} a month, after completion of said payments the debt balance would be forgiven. As previously mentioned, I was making said payments to XXXX XXXX as agreed and in XX/XX/XXXX I was going through some financial difficulties due to my wife 's health and medical issues because of her XXXX. I made payments when I had the means to make them. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, Mr. XXXX gave me an ultimatum that if I did not make my past due payments of {$600.00} by the end of XX/XX/XXXX that my account would be transferred to another debt collector. I made {$1000.00} in payments to First Investors and by chance wanted to get a status update on my account from Mr. XXXX. However, he never responded to my phone messages. I later found out that Mr. XXXX breached his arrangement with me and forwarded my account to another debt collector XXXX debt collection. I never received notice of the transfer of my account. I escalated this issue to his manager, Ms. XXXX XXXX. Initially, Ms. XXXX brought back my account from XXXX XXXX XXXX and received another account representative at First Investors. 

Ms. XXXX tried to reassure me that the payments made on my account with First Investors were reflected. I asked her for a copy of the accounting as well as all my documents concerning my account because she said that it was {$3000.00}. All I wanted was proof for my records that said payments were properly reflected before making further payments. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a letter to Ms. XXXX to receive the documents that I requested previously from her department that proved that the balanced still owed on my account was {$3000.00}. She told me that she would place my account on hold, review my file and listen to the recordings ( telephone conversations between Mr. XXXX and myself ) concerning my account. 

Please note, that the only reason that I did not file a complaint earlier was because I unreasonably relied on the assurances made by Ms. XXXX concerning my account. I did not hear from her for two months and found out that First Investors sold my account to another third party debt collector, XXXX XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This whole matter has been handled very unprofessionally as well as under handed concerning my account. I am displeased with the service as well as the attention concerning my account because I felt that had I not inquired about my account, I would've essentially been in limbo because I would have been still paying First Investors in good faith even though they initially transferred my account to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I would like a resolution in this matter and feel that the attempted transferring of my accounts were without merit and deceptive. It is not unreasonable to ask for a proper verified accounting of your account, in light of the mismanagement of my account initially.

The purpose of withdrawing those funds were to pay bills. My transaction took about 5 minutes to process through the drive thru aXXXX XXXX XXXX by teller XXXX Transaction XXXX according to my receipt. On XX/XX/ 2019, after paying my bills I decided to visit the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX Branch to make a deposit into my personal checking account ending in XXXX to pay one last bill.

Eventually, the teller came back out and asked my husband if I was in the car. Which I was in the passenger seat. The teller then notified me that I gave her a {$100.00} counterfeit bill. I was totally in shock because that was the same money that I received from the XXXX XXXX Branch, in fact it remained in the same envelope that I received and locked away only for bill purposes. I explained where I received the money from and the teller looked at the receipt. The teller stated she had to send the money off to the FED as a policy and sent me a suspected counterfeit receipt. I then decided to go back to the XXXX XXXX Branch and speak with the Branch Manager (  XXXX XXXX ) there and she rudely said with no sympathy what so ever that there was nothing she could do and no way of proving it. I requested that the Branch Manger review the cameras and she looked at me in a questionable way and replied we cant do that. I was so upset because I felt like the Branch Manager did not respect me as a loyal customer which I have been banking here for years and I have always managed to take great care of my accounts and have never been overdrawn or have had any items return. The fact that the branch did not protect their customers by running their bills through cash counters or checking them closely makes me worried to keep my funds at Wells Fargo, which I had already brushed things off after hearing so much about the mishaps in the past. I decided to escalate my complaint further since the Branch Manager seems as though she did not care about the matter. I called Customer Service on that same day to file a complaint regarding the service I received and the agent advised me that someone would be contacting me back. The person who was working on my case ( # XXXX ) XXXX called me back the next day on XX/XX/ 2019 and advised me that he would be calling me back later that day or the following day. XXXX did not follow back up with me. I decided to call Customer Sevice back on XX/XX/ 2019. The agent directed me to the person working XXXX. I spoke with XXXX and he basically read an email from the Branch Manager stating that I waited too long and that there was no way to prove that the money came from there. XXXX also included that my sister called the Branch Manager, which she did, only to see what she could do help me since I am younger and have never been any situation like this. She asked the Branch Manager if she could give me a call back and she hung up on her and said there was nothing she could do. XXXX said he would contact the Branch Manager back and let them know that I was not happy with their decision, but was positive that they would not credit my money back. I felt like the bank did not protect my funds and stole from me. I had bills to pay with that money. I did not even want to escalate my complaint to the Branch Manager when it was clearly about her and how she handled the matter without researching it.

A salesman named XXXX XXXX from XXXX informed me that nothing was wrong with the vehicle when I test drove it. He was not honest with me as months later I later discovered that the vehicle instrument cluster was defective. 
The vehicle was transferred down to Miami and a salesman named XXXX XXXX collected my down payment and again assured me that the vehicle had no problems or issues. The XXXX report he provided me did not show the instrument cluster repair. I decided to purchase the car. 

In XXXX of XXXX, I was a victim of financial fraud of {$1000.00} by a lady named XXXX XXXX from PA XXXX case XXXX, XXXX PA XXXX and couldn't afford to make payment then. I informed Santander of this. I made XXXX more payment in late XXXX and in XXXX, Santander gave me a XXXX month extension due to financial hardship and a loss of a family member. In XXXX, I also cancelled the XXXX warranty of {$2800.00} and was refunded this amount by XXXX back to Santander. Since then, I have not made any payments because I discovered that the vehicle instrument cluster was replaced 5 years ago. I complained about this to both XXXX and Santander and neither business tried to resolve the issue. I was also struggling to get permanent employment and I was concerned about the high interest rate of 26 %. I asked for Santander to lower the rate and my request was denied. Without an explanation of the 26 % rate, Santander has forced me to accept that the rate is reasonable for my credit and income level. 
In addition : - Santander never justified the reason for my 26 % rate, the highest in the country - Santander never applied ANY portion of any of my payments ( {$4500.00} total ) towards interest or principal. 
- Santander varied the final payout balance numerous times from {$17000.00} to {$19000.00} to {$16000.00} to {$18000.00} in only a 7 month period. 
- Santander never showed on my account page how much interest is being accrued daily, weekly, or monthly and how much has been paid. 
- Neither Santander nor XXXX offered to replace my car with its defective instrument cluster for a different vehicle. 
- Numerous complaints filed against XXXX by me regarding the defective instrument cluster were ignored by the BBB. 
- I posted a complaint on XXXX against XXXX regarding the replaced instrument cluster and the complaint was removed by XXXX in XXXX. 

Santander promised me that they'll give me until Friday, XX/XX/XXXX to make a payment and they will not repo the vehicle. I told them that I will make payment that day because that's when I'll receive my first paycheck from my new job. Santander agreed and gave me the extension.

Credco has requested 60 days to reply and send my data file as a stall tactic!

03/01/2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"FHA CASE # XXXX A modification was approved on my loan for assistance on or around XX/XX/2018 with Wells Fargo ( WF ). At that time the reported gross qualifying income for my family was stated in the amount of {$6100.00}. 

WF, underwriting team attempted to qualify the loan for whats known as the HAMP-FHA, trial plan on XX/XX/2018, which outlined an alleged affordable payment in the amount of {$2000.00}. However, based on front end debt to income ( DTI ) ratios a gross income of {$6100.00}, and a mortgage payment of {$2000.00}, calculates our DTI, at 33.33 %. This amount of 33.33 %, is outside the guidelines set forth by FHA which has a limit cap of 31 % DTI versus 33.33 % and placed our family into a negative position for successfully completing the trial plan and maintaining payments for the long run. My payment should have been calculated closer to {$1800.00}, based on 31 % of my gross qualifying income. 
Also please note that at the time our loan was approved for assistance our back end DTI, was calculated at 91.13 %. As a result of the gross negligence demonstrated by the WF, underwriting team, and failing to comply with the terms of loss mitigation options under FHA guidelines, we were only able to make 2 of the 3 trial payments prior to dropping out of the program. The Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) has specific guidelines for FHA debt-to-income ratios. HUD is the government entity that establishes all of the rules and requirements for the FHA loan program, including the DTI limits. According to HUD : "" Qualifying ratios are used to determine if the borrower can reasonably be expected to meet the expenses involved in home ownership, and provide for his/her family. '' 2018 DTI Limits for FHA Loans : 31 % on the front end. The guidelines also specify that back end DTI should not exceed 43 %. According to official FHA guidelines, borrowers are generally limited to having debt ratios of 31 % on the front end. Those are the current FHA DTI ratio limits for 2018.

I wear reading glasses and put my glasses into my purse so she could apply the product. I ended up buying the product on XX/XX/2019. The product cost {$320.00} with tax and they also gave me a card for a "" complementary non-surgical face lift experience '' valued at {$600.00}. After I signed the receipt the sales lady asked when did I want to come in for my {$600.00} special. I said I was in a rush and would call later and set a date for that appointment. I did not have my reading glasses on when the sales lady pointed to a place below my signature on the receipt and asked me to initial it. Unfortunately, I could not read what I was initialing without my glasses. I thought my initials were for the {$600.00} special card and that I would call later to schedule it. When I got home and looked in my mirror I was not happy, this {$300.00} product did not work my bags were back. I went back to XXXX XXXX XXXX the next day, XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX XXXX I spoke with a salesman and said I was not happy with the product my bags came back very quickly. I said I had not opened the product and wanted a refund. The salesman said we do not allow refunds and I took out my cellphone and called Capital One, the credit card company that I used to purchase the product. A man a Capital One spoke with the salesman and then the salesman handed the phone back to me. The salesman told me to leave and would not give me a refund. That was around XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I later called Capital One disputes section again ( around XXXX XXXX ) to make sure it was documented. On XX/XX/XXXX I  looked at my Capital One statement and this charge was not disputed. So I called Capital One and the lady in Disputes said because the credit charge had not cleared on XX/XX/XXXX the information that both Capital One employees had entered into the system disappeared. She took down my information and started the dispute again. Capital One sent me a ltr dated XX/XX/2019 requesting that I respond to their letter if I still wanted to dispute the {$320.00} charge. The envelop was run through a Capital One postage meter on XX/XX/XXXX. Within a day or so of receiving this letter I responded to Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX by mail and also faxed the letter. 

Capital One issued a letter to me dated XX/XX/XXXX and this is why I am filing a complain about Capital One : Their letter is requesting, "" A second opinion on company letterhead from another merchant in the same field stating specifically what the original merchant did incorrectly, how the problem can be corrected, and what that will cost. I responded immediately upon receiving this letter. I stated in my XX/XX/XXXX letter that I mailed and also faxed to Capital One that I felt that it was not appropriate. "" I do not believe I should find another merchant and ask them to comment on XXXX XXXX. I think you are asking me to conduct an unethical act. '' There were a few other questions in their letter and I responded to them. I received a telephone call the next day from Capital One and the lady said she received my fax and without the "" second opinion on letterhead '' they would close the case and not in my favor. I told her I disagreed that I had never heard of a company requiring a customer to do such a thing. She said she would be mailing me their response in writing. 

So this complaint is about Capital One requiring a customer to get a second opinion about another company. I don't believe I could find another Spa that would be willing to do such an unethical thing. I tried to return the product within 24 hours of the purchase. I still have not opened the product and when I tried to return the product the salesman said no refunds and would do nothing for me. I believe I should receive a refund. 

Just one more piece of info : I have been a wonderful customer of Capital One for over 19 years, always paying on time and very few refund issues ( this may be the first ) and I am very disturbed that they treat a loyal customer this way.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,FL,,Older American,Consent provided,Web,03/01/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3167068

WF, underwriting team attempted to qualify the loan for whats known as the HAMP-FHA, trial plan on XX/XX/2018, which outlined an alleged affordable payment in the amount of {$2000.00}. However, based on front end debt to income ( DTI ) ratios a gross income of {$6100.00}, and a mortgage payment of {$2000.00}, calculates our DTI, at 33.33 %. This amount of 33.33 %, is outside the guidelines set forth by FHA which has a limit cap of 31 % DTI versus 33.33 % and placed our family into a negative position for successfully completing the trial plan and maintaining payments for the long run. My payment should have been calculated closer to {$1800.00}, based on 31 % of my gross qualifying income. 
Also please note that at the time our loan was approved for assistance our back end DTI, was calculated at 91.13 %. As a result of the gross negligence demonstrated by the WF, underwriting team, and failing to comply with the terms of loss mitigation options under FHA guidelines, we were only able to make 2 of the 3 trial payments prior to dropping out of the program. The Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) has specific guidelines for FHA debt-to-income ratios. HUD is the government entity that establishes all of the rules and requirements for the FHA loan program, including the DTI limits. According to HUD : "" Qualifying ratios are used to determine if the borrower can reasonably be expected to meet the expenses involved in home ownership, and provide for his/her family. '' 2018 DTI Limits for FHA Loans : 31 % on the front end. The guidelines also specify that back end DTI should not exceed 43 %. According to official FHA guidelines, borrowers are generally limited to having debt ratios of 31 % on the front end. Those are the current FHA DTI ratio limits for 2018. Currently these requirements to remain in place throughout the year, since HUD has not announced any changes to them. This means the monthly housing payments should not exceed 31 % of gross monthly income, while the total debt burden should not exceed 43 % of monthly income. Needless to say, we are furious that our loan was mismanaged by WF and staff and our family is considering filing a civil suit in order to force WF, to refrain from this abusive underwriting platform which they operate under as well as have our loan reconsidered for assistance under the proper guidelines set-forth by our loan investor, FHA.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,IN,46385,,Consent provided,Web,03/01/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3166242

I was told that being in forbearance wouldn't hurt, as it is a type of repayment plan multiple times then and until XX/XX/XXXX. 

My loan was transferred to Navient when Sallie Mae was defunct. I called them when I was transferred, and they assured me that utilizing income sensitive repayment options and/or the lowest payment amount, which at times was XXXX $ a month in forbearance, was fine for the PSLF program. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, after re-applying for income sensitive repayment again, I called again, and indicated that I could afford some payment and did not need a full forbearance, and they told me that I qualified for forbearance, and so that is the best thing for me to do. I asked what would happen if I sent payments anyways, and they said, basically nothing, because the balance and interest was so high that sending XXXX-XXXX $ a month wouldn't do any good, and wouldn't change my plan. At that time I was first told that I was not in a program that would qualify me for the PSLF program, and that in order to qualify for that program, I would have to re-consolidate my loans and have my husband co-sign them. She indicated that she was only telling me this because now she was "" legally obligated to do so. '' She indicated that once I reconsolidated I could get into the right program but it would be 10 more years before I qualify, and as it has been 2 decades since my first set of loans, she didn't recommend it as I would be at the 30 year mark anyways. 

I have worked for public agencies with lower pay than public agencies, in public service, since XX/XX/XXXX. I have no idea how many "" qualifying payments '' were made, as often the forbearance was the only option given to me. I suspect that I made roughly 6 years of payments in plans that don't qualify me for the program, and my debt is now over 200,000 $ and my interest rate remains over 6 %. I have been unable to get any clear information about what plans do qualify for the program, and any information from Navient.

My credit score has always been about 785 FICO with the 3 Credit reporting Agencies. Today, my credit score dropped to XXXX due to the fact that BLOOMINGDALES CREDIT reported 30 days LATE Payment to the Bureaus. I immediately contacted the Bloomingdales Credit Department and after waiting ror over 45 minutes being on hold, I was able to speak to Ms. XXXX in Bloomingdales Credit Department I explained the entire situation to her that I never received a statement via email for the past 2 months which I always receive on a monthly basis and I requested that the 30 day past due late payment reported to the credit bureaus be removed and show as being current since it is not my fault that I never received a statement from Bloomingdales and how can I be held responsible. 

The only was I found out that my payment was past due was because I received a phone call from Bloomingdales Customer Service after 2 months letting me know to call Bloomingdales for an important business matter and when I called Bloomingdales Customer Service, I immediately made the payment of {$44.00} and Customer Servicve removed the {$38.00} late fee on the account which brought the balance down to {$0.00}. Since I was on the recorded line with Bloomingdales and they informed me in the beginning of the phone call that all calls may be monitored for quality assurance purposes, I was told by the Bloomingdales Customer Service that there would be no negative reporting to any credit bureaus and I am sure that conversation was recorded on the Bloomingdales phone line since they record calls like the rest of the companies for quality assurance reasons. 

I even requested to speak to a Bloomingdales Credit Department Supervisor and she even refused to assist me in this matter. I explained to her that it was Bloomingdales fault that I had not received statements from them for the past 2 months and she was another rude person just trying to state the facts the the negative reporting would not be removed.

At this point he told me for like the 5th time that our conversation was being recorded and that he needed a minute to email me what I was asking for. He stated that if I hang up while he is sending the email, that they would move forward with the process. I have attached the letter he emailed. What I found interesting is the card number is only XXXX digits. At that point I was done with him. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX to educate him on some information that I had gathered. I did not get XXXX, but got his boss instead. I informed her that I had spoken with XXXX and that they have no record on any accounts tied to my ssn. We checked multiple ways and nothing. I did not get her name, but she wasn't listening. She said it was my debt and that they had bought the debt from a collection agency. When I asked what collection agency, she would not tell me. When I told her that the credit card number she was trying say was mine only had XXXX digits in it, she gruffly responded, "" that doesn't matter ''. I'm pretty sure that proving that I have debt would require an actual card number. Some where along there, she informed me that this debt is from the XXXX 's. Nothing specific, just the XXXX 's. "" Oh he didn't tell you that? "". When I told her about XXXX saying I never had an account, she said very condescendingly that back then it was XXXX XXXX and today it is XXXX. She is absolutely incorrect on that statement. They would not have any records for debit from back then. No he did not. She made sure to tell me that if choose not to pay, that we will end up in small claims court. She repeatedly asked me, "" are you saying you are not going to pay? '' I never once said that. I asked repeatedly for the signed application, what the charges were and where they were made. I was told that I had the only information I was going to get. 
I have now spoken with 3 different representatives from XXXX, the last 2 were made to understand her comments about the debt being from the XXXX 's and that they would not have any records of it because it was XXXX XXXX. They almost laughed. None of them came up with an account of any kind tied to me in any way. 
I have looked at 2 of the 3 credit reports and it shows no collections, no account with XXXX, nothing. I spoke with a representative from XXXX today and she looked in all the places she could look and she found no collections, no XXXX, nothing. 
This is XXXX and I do not know how they can still have an actual license to operate from the State of Illinois. They are nothing more than apparent legal crooks. 
I never received the first letter, call, nothing from anyone. 
And, oh ya, XXXX did a credit check on me on XXXX and XX/XX/2019. The kicker is that they did a credit check two years ago as well. Now why do you suppose they did that? I have never had even a late payment in all the credit I have ever had, let alone an account go to collections.",,"Financial Credit Service, Inc.",AR,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,03/01/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3166947

03/01/2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"In 2016, I was charged over {$1700.00} in overdraft charges after chase bank removed my access to mobile bank deposits. I have recorded conversations with bank employees, recorded with their consent, explicitly stating that the feature was removed due to low funding levels in my account, though no official guidelines were ever presented to me, despite multiple requests. My complaint is split into two parts : 1. ) Chase Bank utilized predatory tactics to remove mobile deposit from consumers who would most benefit from the feature. I was forced to incur heavy overdraft fees, many of which were returned when bank employees agreed that fees were caused exclusively due to the removal of that feature. After multiple instances when the bank agreed with my complaints and reversed fees, they continued agreeing but no longer had the capacity to reverse the charges. In one instance, when the city of XXXX was completely flooded and no street access existed to banks or atms, I was still charged a fee, even when I showed the ability to make a deposit as soon as the streets became accessible. Instances such as this occurred on numerous occasions, and each time employees told me that my feature had been removed due to a history of overdrafts, which was entirely created as a result of the removal, itself. This policy of removing the feature for customers with low or negative balances puts us into a purposeful loop of overdraft fees, which bank employees acknowledged as a known problem. 

2. ) I asked on numerous occasions to be given written or formal guidelines about my rights, as a consumer to utilize the mobile deposit feature. While in my recordings bank employees give vastly different answers about the terms of use, none could provide me with clear written rules. Who qualifies for that feature? When will mine be turned on? Why was the feature removed as a result of overdraft fees? All indicated that the feature was removed due to low funds or overdrafts, but none could explain why removal came as a consequence of those facts. Several employees agreed that this was an unfair practice and indicated that numerous customers called in with similar complaints over time. The second portion of my complaint is thus about the bank 's lack of transparency about customer terms of use. 

My recorded conversations with employees are from XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/2016, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, and XX/XX/16. In total, throughout that period I was assessed {$1700.00} in fees, though {$500.00} were refunded by employees who agreed that I had done all I could to avoid them.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TX,770XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/01/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3166742

Federal law requires that credit card companies apply SCRA benefits in these instances. Upon notification of mobilization, I filled out the archaic American Express SCRA benefit application and provided them with my orders. In the application I requested that the benefits be applied to both my Amex Platinum and Amex XXXX XXXX card. They only applied the benefits to my Amex platinum ( applying lower interest rate and did not charge annual fee ), but they did not apply them to my XXXX XXXX XXXX card. For several months, I attempted to request Amex resolve this and refund my annual fee that I was charged for the XXXX XXXX card. Eventually ( in XXXX ) it was determined that I would need to fill out another application to have these benefits applied to the card. I did so, however, they replied that due to the fact that the orders had ended they would not apply the SCRA benefits retroactively and refund my annual fee. This is absurd that they would apply them to my Platinum card and not my XXXX card, furthermore it's insulting that they don't recognize my mobilization to XXXX XXXX as qualifying for a fee refund. I inquired with several colleagues about this and not only did they have apply for SCRA relief for one card, but Amex also applied the benefit to all of the other Amex cards that they hold. Additionally, they were refunded ALL FEEs they've paid in the past. The fact that I am being singled out and not given the benefits required by federal law is insulting. I've now spent 5 full months trying to rectify this and the support that Amex has given me has been awful. I only have the federal government to turn to now to help me with this.

I walked up to the teller ( I believe her name is XXXX ). I handed the teller the {$1000.00} along with a slip that I believed was a deposit slip, and I told her that I wanted to deposit the cash amount of {$1000.00}. The teller informed me that the slip I handed her was a withdrawal slip and she would fill out the appropriate slip for me, which she did and I signed the slip. The teller did not give me a deposit receipt. We chatted a bit ; I told her that my wife and I were leaving for XXXX the next day and I wanted to deposit the money because I did not want to carry that much cash while travelling, after which I left the bank. 

The day after we got to XXXX, I went to the 5th/3rd bank at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, IL, near my home in XXXX. When I arrived at the bank I proceeded to the teller window and asked to withdraw the {$1000.00}. At that point I was told that there was no record of a deposit for {$1000.00} made at the XXXX branch on XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately called the XXXX branch, when I got home, and was told several conflicting stories about what happened to the cash, from the teller and other employees. 
This ensued for over a period of nine weeks and several frustrating phone calls. The employees have basically told me that I am crazy, I was never in the bank, and that I never made the deposit. I asked to view the security camera footage which will prove that I was in the bank and my request has been constantly denied. The bank manager, XXXX, told me that the security footage will not be clear and will not prove that I was in the bank. 
I find this hard to believe that the footage will not be clear as banks have cameras to record all activity. 

My wife and I returned to XXXX, FL on XX/XX/XXXX and after visiting the bank again, the result is that I am still out the {$1000.00} that I deposited on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Again, I asked to view the security camera footage which will prove that I was in the bank and my request was denied again. We were left with no choice, so we filed a police report, we also filed for a subpoena for the security tapes and, to date, we have not had any resolution to this matter. 

I went to another branch, located on XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, FL to see if I could speak to someone else regarding this issue ; as I did not receive any resolution at the XXXX XXXX XXXX. branch. At the XXXX XXXX branch, I met with Mr. XXXX XXXX and he expressed concern and wanted to assist us in resolving this issue. Mr. XXXX told me to contact the District Manager,  XXXX XXXX. I contact Ms. XXXX and Ms. XXXX contact me back, vial letter, and stated that she reviewed the security tapes and that I was not in the bank. Help me understand, how does Ms. XXXX know what I look like? Ms. XXXX and I have never met. 

This situation has caused a lot of anguish for my wife and me. We are retirees and that money is our social security payment. We have been banking with 5th/3rd Bank since it opened and this is the first time anything like this has happened.

02/28/2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"My ex-husband, XXXX, and I purchased our home 13 years ago using an Adjustable Rate Mortgage because of our low credit scores, planning to refinance once our scores improved. Selena Finance gave us a loan with a rate of 6.5 % fixed rate, which we still hoped to modify as our credit scores increased.After the loss of our XXXX son our marriage suffered and after a long separation, ended in a civil divorce. Sine the original down payment on the property of almost {$30000.00} had been made by me, our divorce decree stated that I keep the house but must refinance to relieve XXXX of his finical obligation. Once I had received the Release of Interest from XXXX I contacted Selena to begin the process and learned that being a stay at home mother may have cost my family our home.

Even though I had already been separated and making the payments on my own for over a year, Selene denied my application for a loan modification because I did not have stable employment during my marriage because my husband provided enough that I was able to stay home and raise our family, because I had no income of my own my credit did not qualify loan requirements.. Not wanting our daughter to loose her home and having trust in me, my X agreed to give me more time to remove him from the financial liability while worked on finding ways to qualify. In XX/XX/XXXX I began struggling to keep my mortgage current, so I once again contacted Selene Finance and requested a Borrowers Assistance Form hoping to lower my payments..The balance of my loan was approximately {$79000.00} and the Selene representative I spoke to informed me that my payments could possibly be reduced from {$800.00} to around four or five hundred dollars, although XXXX would still be included on the loan it would be a big finical relief..The representative also advised me that if this option failed to work that although they could not help me refinance my loan at the time, if I were to file bankruptcy then by law they would have to work with me to adjust my loan. When I received no response to the form I had submitted and had been unable to contact anyone by phone or internet to discuss my situation with I considered the other option suggested by the Selene representative. 
I contacted a bankruptcy lawyer in XXXX, WA who gave me more discouraging information, although my credit was too low to qualify for a loan, my debt was too low to qualify for bankruptcy. Although he did inform m that if my mortgage became delinquent and went into foreclosure that bankruptcy would immediately stop that process and force my bank to modify my loan, and would save my family 's home. Reluctantly but with minimal options I followed his advice, but quickly attempted change my decision but was too late. In XX/XX/XXXX was the first time ever that my payment had not been on time and i was, by the end of XXXX I was regretting this choice and attempted to contact Selene on the XXXX, XXXX and XXXX by phone and online but was unable, my internet access had been blocked by Selene and I could not get passed the automated operators to make a payment or speak to a representative to repair my account On XX/XX/XXXX I was finally able to speak to a Representative who was able to unlock my online access to my account, but could not accept the payment I was attempting to submit. Since it was the first of a new month balance now totaled three payments due, and even though I had attempted for three days to make this payment, Selene refused to accept any payment less that two months total amount. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was informed that no supervisor would be able to override this policy and refused my request to be transferred. Since I had used some of the money to catch up on some of the other bills I had been struggling with I only had enough money to cover one months payment at the time. Since I was already in finical distress I had no way to come up with the funds to repair my loan and avoid foreclosure, so my only option was to follow the advice I had received from the Selene rep and file for bankruptcy.

Once I got notice that Selene had started the foreclosure process I met with an attorney and filed for bankruptcy in order to save my home. The day after filing with the court my attorney contacted me to inform me that Selene had done something he had rarely seen banks do, they had filed a motion to be excluded from my bankruptcy and scheduled my home for auction the
following week. Once again I contacted Selene to discuss options to keep my home, but again, I was unable to get through to speak to any person, however I was contacted by a nonprofit attorney 's office offering to assist me and was informed that the auction had been postponed. I expected this extra time to been intended to renegotiate my loan and save my home.

Again I was denied by Selene Finance when inquired about my options, since I was now in bankruptcy there was no possibility of them considering me for a loan until at least two years after my case was discharged, regardless of what led me to that position. I decided to to complete the bankruptcy process since besides my home loan i had very little debt to consider, however it had cost me almost two grand that is not refundable to have the attorney file my case with the courts. 
On XX/XX/XXXX my home was scheduled for auction at which it was purchased by Selene Finance according to the Notice to Vacate that I received shortly afterwards. I postponed moving by submitting a letter to the attorney stating that I was disputing the legality of the sale, based on the fact that Selene Finance had refused to modify my loan and it was their representative who advised me to use bankruptcy to get my loan modified to an affordable rate.

I recently learned that Selene Finance is not actually the lender for my mortgage, they are a company contracted to collect the funds. However it was Selene Finance that refused to accept my payments, denied to modify my loan, advised me to use bankruptcy to save my home, and then purchased my home from the auction that they had scheduled.",,Selene Finance LP,WA,,,Consent provided,Web,02/28/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3165205

I can enumerate all of the issues below : Initially, I have always been a public servant when repaying my student loans, and have always attempted to be qualified for the public service loan forgiveness program.

1. I was given completely incorrect information regarding payment plans, payment amounts, and was not provided the right information regarding the lowest payment possible. For the first several years ( XXXX ) I was not making the lowest payment possible. I found out many years later that I could have qualified for payments under {$100.00} a month, but was paying 2 or 3 times that amount at any point.

2. I took out a mortgage on my home to pay down my balances. I made it VERY clear that I wanted the payment to go towards the principal balance. Yet, Navient ( around XX/XX/XXXX ) repeatedly applied the balance to future payments. For nearly 3 months I repeatedly called Navient to have them apply the balance to the principal. I am still unsure if they charged me interest on the larger principal balance during that time. 

3. I was told in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX and again in XX/XX/XXXX that I did not have to certify my student loans for PSLF until I had made 120 payments, and that Navient was keeping track of those payments. However, I recently found that many of my coworkers certify their employment on an annual basis, and that their loans are held by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I attempted, once a month, for the last 18 months ( XX/XX/XXXX to present day ) to get information from Navient regarding any PSLF certification paperwork. They REPEATEDLY told me they would send me information via email or mail, and I would never receive this paperwork. Finally, I went online and did a search on my own. I have attempted to get documentation regarding my numerous phone calls and was told they do not email others. Further, I was told that they do not keep any log of calls made by borrowers.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",VA,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,02/28/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3165576

I didn't even know what the remaining deficiency balance was until my credit was pulled. When I was advised it was on my credit I contacted the company asking for them to send me a paper with the detailed information about the deficiency balance and what they got for the vehicle at auction and so forth. I was told it would be sent, they had an old address which I had updated but clearly was never updated so once again I gave them the new address. I still never received any letters providing information. I never received any calls either. All of a sudden someone shows up to my home and asked my XXXX year old where I was and she told them I was outside so this man walks up to me and hands me a civil summons and says this is for you and XXXX. He never asked me my name or anything. When I review the papers I see its civil summons for the vehicle and on the papers once again they have an old address that I have told them I was no longer at.

I have never received calls from them and if they called they never left a voicemail stating who they were and where to call. I never received any documents in the mail either.

I add a note every month to spread my payment across all loans in full. Every month my account shows that I am behind {$100.00}. Every month I call Navient to fix the issue and I get the same response. "" We ( Navient ) didn't apply your payment across all of your loans ( even though I added a note to do so ), that's why its showing a pass due amount. Navient then sends a request to another one of their departments to spread my payments evenly. I go through this every month for 6-8 months. 

This month my online portal is the same {$180.00}. I make the payment and again I am behind {$100.00}. I call and I am told my new loan amount is {$290.00} and I am behind {$100.00}, again. I was not yet told that my amount has been raised to the new number of {$290.00}. My online portal still says {$180.00}. I haven't gotten a clear answer on why my current pass due of {$100.00} with the new payment of {$290.00} is equal to the previous pass due of {$100.00} when my monthly payments were {$180.00}. 

There are two issues here. 
1. Every Month I make a payment in full Navient doesn't spread my loan equally even after I am told for now on they will spread my loan out equally. And even though I attach a note to each check to spread my loan out equally. If I were to send my check in and not check my account this would have drastically hurt my credit score. This is an obvious practice that they will continue to do. I have been told they will fix it by multiple Navient representatives who I will list below. 

2. I made my usual payment and once again pass due. But this time its because my payment was increased and I was not notified. The increase was not posted on my Navient online portal. Why is the current pass due amount with a new payment equal to previous pass due amounts that I have been making of a different payment? Why is Naveint continuingly trying to get an extra {$100.00}?

In early XX/XX/XXXX, I got a call from "" XXXX '' in the Recovery Department at Specialized Loan Servicing. He indicated that my mortgage payments were two payments behind. I was shocked, because I knew that they had been made. I asked him to research it, because I had made the payments. I had worked with XXXX all the way through my modification process, so I was confident that he would get to the bottom of the problem and I really trusted him to do what he said he would. Later, he called and told me that I needed to write a letter, showing that I had made the payments. NEVER was I told that I was sending a letter too late to be helped, etc. XXXX also sent me a print out of all the payments that I had made. I could NOT see in the print out where I had not made a payment. I did see that my XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments had been misapplied to Principal. 

I sent a letter to SLS, by Fax on XX/XX/XXXX. In that letter, I explained that our payments had been made on time and that they had not been applied correctly. Some time later, I got a letter saying that SLS would not fix their mistake. I continued to make my payment each month and really didn't worry about it. I figured that I would eventually get them to fix it and they weren't taking any action against us. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I got a call saying that I need to make up now 3 payments. For a total of {$500.00} and that if I wanted to, I could add a little to each payment to make up the difference. I was just infuriated because I don't owe this money. It is literally the PRINCIPLE of the matter. I can pay them this money, but I don't feel I should have to, because I did pay it. I also don't understand how they can say that their Cash Department just won't "" Fix '' the mistake. It's literally an inputting error. 

Then, I received a Default Notice dated XX/XX/XXXX. I called and was told that I could not even make up the payments and that no payment would be accepted until it was the full amount. 

My payments are still being sent to SLS in the same manner, directly from my bank AND they're still be accepted. 

My XX/XX/XXXX statement says that I am only one payment behind. And that I only owe {$350.00}. However, when I called today, I was told that I owed for 2 months, plus my next XXXX payment for a total of {$500.00}. 

I want the following assistance from your organization : 1. I would like SLS to make an exception to their "" rule '' and fix their mistake on our loan and correctly our payments. 

I am quite concerned for other consumers who they might have done this to. Our situation is unusual in that our payment isn't very high at all. I can make this payment, but what about people who have a large payment. What about them? I wonder if this is an ongoing practice with in SLS? 

I would also the Consumer Finance Department to counsel SLS on correctly preparing statements. How can I owe all these different amounts? It makes No sense. 

I would appreciate any help that your agency can offer and I would like your help in working with SLS to do the right thing and fix their mistake.

02/28/2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Background : Home purchased in XX/XX/XXXX on an FHA XXXX Rehab loan using XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Money Source appears to have purchased our debt, with an effective date of XX/XX/XXXX. Borrowers do not remember official notification or authorization for our account to be transferred. 

Significant Dates : ( D.1 ) XX/XX/XXXX : we received a bill from TMS with a significant change in our monthly amount due. My spouse contacted TMS ( XXXX ) to inquiry what changed. We discovered that there were discrepancies in the escrow account and that TMS would investigate. 
( D.2 ) XX/XX/XXXX : TMS ( XXXX ) contacted my spouse to inform us that our real estate tax wasnt entered correctly, and so TMS paid the bill. TMS then unilaterally developed a payment plan over 12 months which would increase our monthly payment by approximately $ 800/month. Paraphrasing from TMS ( XXXX ), TMS paid the bill, so you will be paying TMS back and now paying the correct payments towards escrow on future billing cycles. We explained that the significant change in monthly billing cycles is still unacceptable due to the significant financial hardship it would cause and that we should not be penalized for their error. TMS ( XXXX ) stated that she understood our concern and that the matter would be looked at further by TMS and someone would call us back. 
( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX : Because no representatives from TMS had contacted us, my spouse called them to inquire what other options were available. Eventually, a supervisor/lead ( XXXX ) was placed in touch with my spouse. Paraphrasing TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) information was entered incorrectly, but we have to pay for the XXXX their ) deficiency. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) then recommended that our insurance be lowered to decrease monthly bill cycles to compensate for the high monthly payment. Due to my status as active component military TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) also recommended that we pursue local tax exclusions/benefits to limit our monthly payments. Because of my spouses concern that our conflict was not being resolved, she asked for TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) to contact me ( primary borrower on account ). 
( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX : TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) contacts primary borrower via voicemail as requested, but fails to leave an extension number to be reached. I was on hold for approximately 38 minutes before being routed to an operator/customer care representative and then placed on hold for another approximate five minutes to contact the TMS Supervisor. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) apologized for the delay and failure to provide adequate contact information beyond I am the only ( XXXX ) in the department and one of four team leads. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) then explained to the me ( primary borrower ) that the property taxes was not entered or calculated correctly, and that the responsibility rests with the borrower. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) then again recommended that I adjust my insurance to compensate for the error, however, I see this as an inappropriate/unauthorized person directing what risks I should take as both an owner and borrower. He further recommended that I ask local authorities for exemptions due to my military status. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) offered to extend the re-payment to 24 or possibly 36 months to compensate for the escrow shortfall. I ( primary borrower ) requested additional documentation from TMS due to my concern about how, where, and why my payments were being used. I also stated that in my lay knowledge, I understood and considered TMS to be in multiple violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RSPCA ), especially in consideration of potentially improperly applying or crediting payments, neglecting to pay taxes, and failing to provide information on workout options. Additionally, I stated to TMS Supervisor that I may write a formal notice of error in accordance with the RSPCA and file a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX if my lay research into the issue indicated that was appropriate to do so. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) explained that he understood, was sorry, and indicated that the mistake may have been TMS. Although the TMS Supervisor ( XXXXt ) was courteous and polite on the phone, I do not feel that he is/was enabled to remedy the problem in a manner that I feel is reasonable. 

Other concerns noted leading to decision to file complaint : ( C.1 ) TMS stated to spouse that they did not know they were responsible for property taxes or amount, but they had previously paid it.

I just recently ( the past 3 years ) got a full-time position. I have been paying my loan for several years using the Income Driven Repayment Plan. I pay on time every month. Just recently, I noticed things were not getting any better, and I decided to check my loan balance. I wrote it down at the beginning of XXXX. It was XXXX, XXXX. I paid again on XX/XX/XXXX, and my balance was up to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. I haven't missed a payment, I pay on time, but I am not making any headway. I decided to call to find out what was going on. The first women told me in 25 years my loan would be forgiven. I will be XXXX. She did not offer any help, so I called back. The second rep offered me the graduated repayment plan, if I paid a {$5.00} exit fee, and put my loan into forebearance. I asked about the interest during that time, and she said XXXX would accrue. I then asked if there was a different option, and why is it that I would have to pay {$5.00} to exit, plus the interest. She then told me I could straight up pay XXXX to exit the plan. I do not have an extra {$2000.00}. I ended up paying the XXXX, and told her I would pay the XXXX during the forebearance. I had also just paid toward my monthly payment, and she told me that XXXX would go toward the interest during forebearance. She also stated that my loan would be paid in 10 years because the payments go up a little every 2 years. I was feeling better. 
This morning, I checked my email. I had 4 emails regarding my NEW plan, which is actually the SAME one I am currently on. Not the graduated plan I had spoken to the rep about. I called again this morning while at work. The women told me she would email the information about the graduated plan in 2-4 hours. It is XXXX. I called this morning at XXXX. She asked me if I wanted them to also send correspondence via postal mail. I said yes. I wanted all the confirmation in writing that they could provide. 
I also just sent them an email on their website : Good evening, I had contacted a representative yesterday regarding a different payment plan. I paid {$5.00} to exit my Income Driven repayment plan, put it into forebearance until XXXX, and then begin a Graduated Repayment Plan at {$600.00}. I received 4 emails stating the terms of my Income Based plan. This is not correct. I DO NOT have this plan any longer. I exited out for XXXX and switched plans. The rep told me my new payment was going to be {$600.00} and some change, that I could pay the interest while my loan is in forebearance, and my NEW payment would start the XXXX of XXXX. EVERY email correspondence that I have received does NOT reflect the changes. 
I phoned this morning and the rep offered to email me the NEW terms for the graduated plan, and that I would receive them within 2- 4 hours. I did not. I also asked her to mail them.

The Issue - I have made a couple of late payments and late fees were assessed. I made payments to cover the late payments and late fees. Well, I was looking at my loan account when I went to make the most recent payment and noticed all of these fees, {$130.00}. 
Before contacting the lender, I looked through all of my payments to make sure that the error was not on my end. According to my calculations, for the eleven months that I have paid the car note, it adds up to {$6000.00} plus an additional {$130.00} in the late fees. To date, I have paid {$6200.00} which was supposed to cover my car note and the accrued late fees. 
I called the finance company to ask why am I seeing {$130.00} in outstanding fees considering when I made payments according to the bills received, the late fees were apart of the monies paid. According to the agent, despite the fees showing on the bill and me sending in the payments were never applied to the late fees so the late fees are outstanding and past due. He stated that I would have had to have called and asked that the funds be applied to the late fees.

I am submitting this complaint in reference to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, section 808, line 1, which states the following : 808. Unfair practices A debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section : ( 1 ) The collection of any amount ( including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation ) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law. 

This means that, unless the original creditor, or to whom the debt is owed to, has already included in this debt any interest or fees, and/or has disclosed in an agreement creating the debt that interest is to be charged on any balance, it is against this law for any collection agency to collect interest on such debts.

02/28/2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"Hurricane Irma in 2017 had major impact on my income and did damage to my house. I inquired about the forebearance option. The way it was presented to me was that since I could not afford the current payment they would suspend payments until the work to fix my house was completed. They gave me two options for once the work was completed ; I could either pay ( make current ) the payments that were not made during the suspension or they could remodify the loan. I specifically asked about the modification due to the fact that my income potential was drastically reduced ( due to Hurricane ). My question was to the point ... the only modification to the loan would be the  length ... if loan is suspended for say 3 months then the loan maturity date gets extended by the same. Their answer was yes. It took 9 months to get insurance company to correctly payout and get work completed, so there were no mortgage payments made for those 9 months. Once completed Loan Depot sent me a trial modification program to get the process started. I was told that the higher payments were to assist in getting the escrow balances back on track, I made all the payments ( on time ). Then came the loan modification itself, documents came along with foreclosure, short sale and deed-in-lieu documents. This scared me to death so I signed the new loan. My payments went from roughly $ XXXX/month to $ XXXX/month due to an additional {$18000.00} being added to the loan. They said it was for the unpaid months during forebearance. I called several times trying to get clarification but got the run-around each time. Not sure how it works ... loan payments were suspended ... yet they are charging me for them as if they made them for me. Again I go back to my question prior to accepting the forebearance program, trust me if I had any inclination that they would added that money to the loan I would have never done the program. They also talked on fees ( not sure for what ) and reported me to the credit bureaus as late over 120 days ... which they promised me they would not do. 

I feel as if I was scammed, the program is to assist people in times of trouble and because of it I have an even bigger problem now.

A return also occurred on one transaction that was removed from the balance.

I was a few weeks over the line on this small remaining balance and was assessed a finance fee of XXXX on about a $ XXXX balance.

To make matters worse, they have assessed a late fee on a remaining balance of {$25.00} that I did not know about. Now they want {$56.00} in total. This was not a balance that I had financed with them but another fee. 

The just outcome would be a total return of the interest balance that was paid to them. I had made my payments in good faith and even paid the interest balance to make sure nothing ended up affecting my very good credit rating, however being so unreasonable with a credit report to threaten is a bully 's approach of doing business.

02/28/2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Freedom Mortgage Account # XXXX Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  This letter is a formal complaint against Freedom Mortgage. 

My Hardship begins when my loan was transferred in a pool as clarified by several of the representatives from collections. They were unable to see my very first payment from XX/XX/XXXX. In their system it shows my first payment in XXXX XXXX and already in default. That is the beginning of when the account becomes an a issue. I attempted to resolve by contacting Freedom Mortgage. The problem that exists is there is no single point of contact in order to communicate. Whenever there is a call made, the situation needs to be explained to a different customer service representative each time who has no authority to correct errors on an account. They produce a ticket that goes electronically to another geographical location. I am not allowed to communicate with that department as explained by customer service. Furthermore I am told it can take 30 days and someone will contact me. Which is not the result on several occasions. 

Facts are I did make that XX/XX/XXXX payment. I made that payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I have a letter from freedom mortgage for a confirmation of electronic payment for {$1700.00}. confirmation number XXXX. I have been informed by customer representatives they can not see this payment. I provided them with copy of there confirmation letter of payment. 

Second error as explained to me by one of Freedom mortgage representatives my mortgage payments were being divided, making it appear as a partial payment or insufficient funds. Reasons unexplained other than possible processing error in cashiering department. I was informed there is no option to communicate with cashiering department. 

Third error, by XXXX XXXX I was told I was paying for XXXX. I had already made payments for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. I proceeded to make two payments in XXXX for XXXX and XXXX knowing I haven't missed a payment. Continued for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX by this time account was a complete disaster. I was unable to speak with anyone with the authority and the knowledge to correct the problem. Since then, the account has become a disaster and difficult to correct. 

I have provided Freedom Mortgage with proof of payments for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. There customer representatives corrected 3 received but unapplied payments and confirmed all other payments received. It was clarified I am in error of missing a XX/XX/XXXX payment which I am at fault. Every payment there after has been made. 

My account states I haven't made a payment since XX/XX/XXXX. I have proven that not to be true, yet no one has corrected this in my account. Furthermore the fees that accrued inaccurately since XXXX further complicate account. 

I have been served with a summons and complaint from an attorney requesting {$21000.00} in order to reinstate my account. I can confidently make my monthly mortgage payments. I can not pay a lump sum of {$21000.00} for errors self inflicted by Freedom Mortgage lack of a better Administrative structure Sadly this is not an isolated incident, there are more than a 1000 complaints if not more of similar complaints.

XXXX assured both XXXX and I that the interest rate and credits would be matched and that I had no worries going forward. XXXX then contacted me by phone and said that in order to make the deal work for her upper management that she needed a "" good faith '' deposit to lock in the deal. She assured me that the money would be applied to the loan at closing and that if Caliber could not fulfill their promises with regards to the credit and rates then the money would be refunded. I asked her several times about this through the loan process both in person and over the phone. She was even bold enough to state "" don't worry about what any of the disclosures state, what I tell you is what matters ''. Therefore, I did everything she said and signed everything she told me to. I paid my "" good faith '' deposit of {$1900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by XXXX because we were within 30 days of closing. This was the first time she told me that she was not going to be able to match the rate she promised.

XXXX did his best to try and repair the broken deal but still could not meet the rates offered by XXXX. XXXX also refused to document our phone conversations and only would discuss rates, or deposits over the phone. I realized why he did this when I asked to end my relationship with XXXX and have my "" good faith '' deposit returned. It was at this point that XXXX told me the deposit was nonrefundable and they would not return the money.

I have a checking account with Bank of America. I was told that there would be no fees in this account as long as there was a balance of {$2000.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX, I withdrew some funds, leaving about {$2100.00}. I made no further withdrawals until XX/XX/XXXX. For years, I had been charged no fees.

Since I wrote no checks during XX/XX/XXXX, and I had no reason to believe that Bank of America would start taking my money without informing me, I saw no reason to look at bank statements online. As a result, I did not find out that they had taken my money until I went online on XX/XX/XXXX. By that time, Bank of America had removed {$170.00} from my account. I called Bank of America that day.

02/28/2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"I write to you regarding the improper actions of Chase with respect to the FHA servicing of a loss mitigation review, approval and subsequent denial thereof for the above referenced account. 
As described below, Chases misconduct in this matter resulted in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in connection with loan servicing, foreclosure, loss mitigation, violation of homeowners rights and protections and the use of deceptive practices resulting in a waste and abuse of taxpayer funds Each of the allegations regarding Chase contained herein applies to instances in which Chase, either itself or through its affiliates, agents or subsidiaries, engaged in the conduct alleged. 
Based on the facts and behavior of the Chase, we feel that they have intentionally taken steps to avoid honoring the FHA loan modification approval that was issued in XX/XX/2018. Said behavior has harmed the borrower and will ultimately harm the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. Per the federal statute, a loan servicer shall engage in loss mitigation actions for the purpose of providing an alternative to foreclosure .... ' Id. 1715u ( a ). A mortgagee `must consider the comparative effects of their elective servicing actions, and must take those appropriate actions which can reasonably be expected to generate the smallest financial loss to the Department [ of housing and Urban Development ]. ' 24 C.F.R. 203.501. '' The borrower for the above referenced account was in default on his monthly payments and applied for a loan modification. Via letter dated XX/XX/2018 Chase approved the borrower for a loan modification. That approval was received on XX/XX/2018. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a copy of the approval. The approval included a FedEx label, which indicated that something needed to be returned to Chase. My office reached out to Chase and was told that the signature page of the trial modification was not included, but because the matter was being litigated no further information could be provided and that it was necessary to contact Chases attorney. Thereafter, on XX/XX/2018 my office contacted Chases attorneys office requesting a complete trial modification so that it could be signed and sent back to Chase, at which point Chases attorneys office replied that Trial modification should require no signatures, simply that they make their first payment within the timeframe indicated so we should be all set. ( emphasis added ). See the email communications between my office and Chases attorney attached as Exhibit B. 
Thereafter, the borrower timely made both his first and second trial payments as required. Then, on XX/XX/2018 Plaintiffs attorney forwarded a letter dated XX/XX/2018 to my office which was a trial approval requiring a signature, it appears that the XX/XX/2018 letter had originally been sent to the borrowers prior attorney. Attached hereto as Exhibit C is a copy of the XX/XX/2018 email. Then, on XX/XX/2018 the borrower received a letter, dated XX/XX/2018, stating that the modification had been terminated because the borrower failed to timely return the signed trial plan. Attached hereto as Exhibit D is a copy of that letter. On XX/XX/2018, after communicating with Chases attorney, the borrower returned the signed trial plan, which had only been received five days before, and requested Chase honor the loan modification offer. Then, the borrower attempted to make the XX/XX/2018 trial payment, but that payment was rejected for not being in certified funds, and then when the borrower sent the money in certified funds, it was again rejected by Chase. See returned payment attached hereto as Exhibit E. 
After additional communication the borrower was informed, in XX/XX/2018, that Chase would honor the loan modification provided the borrower made the XXXX, XXXX and XXXX payments in one lump sum. Attached hereto as Exhibit F is a copy of the email directing such payment. However, the borrower was unsure of where to send the payment, he requested wiring instructions or for Chase to take the payment over the telephone, but that could not be done, and therefore the borrower was unable to send the payment until XX/XX/2018 which is when he learned of the correct address. Attached hereto as Exhibit G is a copy of the payment. Chase rejected this payment too. Attached hereto as Exhibit H is a copy of the rejection. 
Thereafter, the borrower was advised by Chases attorney that his best course of action was to apply for another loan modification, which was thereafter denied by Chase. Attached hereto as Exhibit I is a copy of the denial letter. A foreclosure sale has now been scheduled for the borrowers home. Attached hereto as Exhibit J is a copy of the notice of sale. 
The actions of Chase in this action have been totally improper. This is a FHA loan and is therefore insured by HUD, which means that if the loan suffers a loss, HUD will need to pay a claim. Because this is a government insured loan, Chase was required to take those appropriate action which can reasonably be expected to generate the smallest financial loss to the Department pursuant to 12 C.F.R. 203.501. Here, the borrower demonstrated not only an ability to pay the loan, but a willingness to do so as well. Moreover, it is clear that the only cause of the alleged default with respect to the proposed modification was as a result of certain communication breakdowns, and not due to any inability to reluctance to pay. In fact, it should be noted that the borrower tendered each and every payment that came due, which payments were either accepted or made in certified funds, thereby showing that the modification was possible. 
By refusing to honor the loan modification, Chase has created a situation wherein the borrower stands to be harmed, through the loss of his home, HUD stands to be harmed by potentially paying out a claim that it would not need to pay but for Chases refusal to honor the modification, while Chase will suffer no harm as it is fully insured by HUD. This is in clear violation of 12 C.F.R. 203.501 and would appear to be in bad faith, and is against the public policy of New York. 
Therefore, in light of Chase, and its attorneys, repeated malfeasance or nonfeasance, as the case may be, wherein the borrower was told explicitly that no signature was necessary for the trial modification, when Chase did require such a signature, Chases rejection of trial payments despite agreeing to honor the modification, Chases failure to timely provide a mailing address for a three month lump sum trial payment, and then Chases rejection of that payment, after informing the borrower that such payment would be accepted, you should find that Chase has acted improperly and therefore mete out any punishment deemed appropriate for its handling of this matter.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NY,104XX,,Consent provided,Web,02/28/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3166136

The agent also tried to pull my report on his end and was unable. The next day I called again and was told after reaching a US rep that it may be because I had a fraud alert on my file. The alert was 10 years old and I had never had an issue getting my report or score with it on there. The agent reached out to the backend people and had the alert removed after verifying my info. She told me that was more than likely the issue and to try in 15 minutes or the next day. The next day I tried again and still there were errors with pulling the report. I tried again through XXXX, XXXX XXXX and Equifax directly. I was getting multiple error codes ( Eval Code : - Status Code : FL, Reason Code : TF ) but was being told there was still nothing in my file that would prevent anyone from pulling my report. The agent said he could see my report and could mail me a copy. The call ended with him telling me there was nothing wrong with my file even though I was getting errors from EQUIFAX directly since that is who I was working with. 

We are roughly 3 months from finishing a home build and really needed to be able to access my credit report to see where my report was so there would be no surprises. The lack of care or effort for a company like EQUIFAX to fix this when its such an important part of someones life is completely unacceptable for a company to do and is borderline criminal in the neglect they have for such information. I need EQUIFAX to actually fix and acknowledge the issue instead of passing me off to a different department and claiming there is not an issue. This as of now will prevent me from obtaining the home loan we need until the issue is fixed.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",TX,786XX,,Consent provided,Web,02/27/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3164067

02/27/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I made a purchase at a store inXX/XX/XXXX, with payments to be made through PayPal. I chose this mode of payment because they offered six months of no interest. My goal was to pay it off in six months. I made my first three payments via email statements from them, to my email address. Then the email statements stopped. Throughout this period and beyond, I never received email or paper statements through the mail. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, when I received my first paper statement from them, saying that I was delinquent in my payments and had accrued {$350.00} in late fees and interest. 

When I immediately called, to try to understand what had happened, I was told that the email address on file for my account ( at Paypal ) was different than mine- VERY different. That had never been my email address. I sent documentation to show that they had my correct and only email address beginning in XXXX, when this transaction was initiated. 

I was horrified that this happened, and sent a check for the balance due, which was {$1400.00}. That did not include the interest charges and late fees. 

I requested that those fees be waived, as I never received any statements from them after XXXX. I did not want to be penalized for not receiving statements after that point. 

I was told I could write a complaint to a particular department, which I did right away. I sent it "" certified '', to make sure it was received. After no response, over a few weeks, I called again. They said they received it, but were still not willing to hear my story. I continue to get monthly bills, with additional fees, and feel strongly about NOT being penalized for NOT paying those months that I didn't receive statements. Their customer service team is simply not willing to understand what happened, on my end. 

I have a very high credit score, and I always pay my bills on time. If I had seen the "" missing '' statements, I would have paid those bills. Instead, I stopped getting them, and forgot about the balance due. Out of sight- out of mind. 

In the enclosed attachments, you'll see that they had my correct email address in our first few transactions. I never changed my email address! One of the representatives I spoke to, said that they always sent their statements through the US mail, which never happened. It was always through email.

02/27/2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"So I have been using my Citibank account for approximately 8 years now. I recently decided to have my account closed on XX/XX/XXXX due to inactivity and previous problems I had with this company. I went to a Citibank Branch on that date and have both my checkings and savings account closed and withdrew all the money I had left inside. I went online on that same date to do a final check to make sure there is no remaining balances and that the account was indeed closed. While checking, I found out that Citibank had charged me a monthly service fee twice without my prior knowledge on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. According to Citibank policies, as long as I have a combined balance of {$1500.00} I should be exempt and not be charged a monthly service fee. I have always treated my Citibank account as an emergency banking account in the recent years just in case I would need to use it but never actually did. With this said, I always had a little bit over {$1500.00} as the combined balance without any withdrawals or deposits ever made. So technically I should never have to worry about any fees right? Nope, that's not the case for Citibank because they can hit you with a fee at their disposals. This already happened once previously on around XX/XX/XXXX when they suddenly just charge me with a monthly service fee despite my combined balance of over {$1500.00}. I contacted a Citibank representative right away and addressed the problem. It was a hassle but the agent admit it was their fault and refunded that monthly service fee on my account at XX/XX/XXXX. He acknowledges the error, issued the refund and told me I should be all set going forward and not have to worry about any more fees on my account in regards to this. Obviously being the person I was, I believed their professionalism during that time and took his word for it. But guess what! I got charged that same monthly service fee twice afterwards. Due to it being the same issue, I contacted a representative again who then transferred me to a supervisor due to her lack of authority to handle the issue given my account is now closed which was understandable. So I went ahead and informed XXXX ( She refused to provide me her last name 's initial but I manage to get her badge # which is XXXX ), the supervisor, of the situation. So basically to sum things up, I told her I don't know why Citibank kept charging me monthly service fees despite my account having a constant total balance of over {$1500.00}. She responded by saying, well your account balance was under {$1500.00} after the fees was taken so they had to charge me a monthly service fee. I was so dumbfounded after she said that. Really? If you charge me a fee I wasn't suppose to pay in the first place to bring the balance down causing another fee to be taken, isn't that in error of Citibank? She monotonously said nope, your balance is under {$1500.00} so the fee was charged correctly ... Please someone help this lady, this is so illogical. To put salt on the wound, she said it was my responsibility to constantly monitor my account as they send banking statements all the time ( true to a certain degree, but really? ) and I should be aware of any errors. So instead of taking the representative 's word from your company back on my XX/XX/XXXX encounter, I should be constantly on guard to see when Citibank makes another strike and charge me with another monthly service fee. That shift in responsibility and not owning the occasion is just unbelievable. XXXX doesn't show any care or professionalism at all quoting things like how long the call has been like I was wasting her time despite me being patient with her during the whole conversation ... so all in all, because my account is now closed, she don't give half a dam about me or the money they "" stole '' from me via their so-called monthly service fees. Before this call was made on XX/XX/XXXX I was still able to access my online account to see the last of my statement but after speaking with XXXX, she apparently closed everything out and denied me access so I wasn't able to provide any additional proofs such as statement balances etc but they should still be on their system ...

XXXX XXXX immediately called XXXX back and spoke with a Supervisor who stated that XXXX XXXX owed an outstanding Debt from XXXX XXXX XXXX  despite him never having been sent any correspondence via US Mail or Email with XXXX XXXX XXXX  as he had corresponded with them hundreds of times in the past ( see pdf XXXX Previous Email Correspondence ). XXXX XXXX corresponded that he had had mail forwarding through the US Post Office ( see pdf XXXX USPS Change of Address Confirmation and XXXXUSPS Mail Hold ) to his new address and never received any correspondence from XXXX XXXX XXXX  about any outstanding debt owed. The Supervisor stated that the XXXX was allegedly mailed to XXXX XXXX at his old address, but she was unable to provide proof of returned mail nor explain why it was never forwarded to XXXX XXXX or sent to him at his email address like previous correspondence from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Supervisor stated that verification of the Debt would be mailed by ProCollect to XXXX XXXX via US Mail. The Supervisor stated that the alleged debt was reported as delinquent on XXXX XXXX credit report by ProCollect. During both telephone calls, XXXX XXXX stated that he wanted all correspondence regarding this matter to be sent to him via email or US. Mail and not via telephone. 

On XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX ( EST ), XXXX XXXX received another automated call from XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX emailed ProCollect indicating again his 2nd request that ProCollect not contact him on his telephone number but rather only via email or US Mail ( see pdfs XXXX XXXX - ProCollect ( 2nd Warning re_ Telephone Calls ) and XXXX XXXX - Re_ ProCollect ( 2nd Warning re_ Telephone Calls ) Amended ) On XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX ( EST ), XXXX XXXX received a letter from ProCollect ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) ( see pdf XXXXProCollect Letter ) alleging that he had an outstanding debt with Lease Term Insurance Group in the amount of {$91.00} and that ProCollect had been referred the account by the original creditor and that XXXX XXXX had 30 days from the date he receives the letter to dispute its validity. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX sent a letter to ProCollect via email and US mail ( see pdf XXXXProCollect Letter ) disputing the validity of this reported debt and request that ProCollect send me verification of the debt. XXXX XXXX also stated again that he requested all correspondence regarding this matter be sent to him only via email or US. Mail. 

On XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX ( EST ), XXXX XXXX received a letter packet from ProCollect ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) ( see pdf XXXX ProCollect Debt Letter ) indicating that our client contends this is a true and valid debt and the attached is the information you requested. On page 7 of the packet, in a very difficult to read discolored page, it states that XXXX XXXX owed {$41.00} for Final Bill and {$50.00} for Cleaning Fees. It is also hand written on the page that on XX/XX/XXXX mailed to address here never forwarded. The remainder of the pages contained unrelated apartment lease documents which did not pertain to the alleged debt. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX submitted yet another dispute letter packet indicating that the information sent by ProCollect does NOT contain any information as the details of this reported debt. The only reference to this reported balance due of {$91.00} is on one page ( very poor quality see attachment ) of the numerous irrelevant documents sent and it merely states that there is a {$50.00} charge for cleaning fees and a {$41.00} charge for final bill. On the line above these charges, it is difficult to read but I believe it states, trash left in garage, clean toilet, bathtub, floors and kitchen pics attached. On this same document, it is handwritten that mailed to address here, never forwarded. XXXX XXXX further details I dispute that any bill was sent to me as I had a mail hold and forwarding to my new address from XX/XX/XXXX onwards ( see attachments ). I received numerous pieces of forwarded mail during the Fall of XX/XX/XXXX at my current address in Indiana but never received anything from XXXX XXXX. It is likely that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not actually mail any Invoice/Bill to me. Ironically, XXXX XXXX and I communicated periodically via email during my XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX leasing term but I never received any email regarding this matter. XXXX XXXX also had my telephone number, but I never received any calls or voicemails from them. The first that I heard of this reported bill is during my telephone conversation with ProCollect on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I am writing again to request the detailed bills for the cleaning fees and final bill. I dispute that these are valid bills for me as I never received them and still have not received details about what the bills are for. Regarding the reported cleaning fees, I took time stamped pictures of the apartment prior to moving out which proves that the apartment was in the same condition as move in. Regarding the trash that was left in the garage ; a representative from XXXX XXXX stated that the item would be taken to the local XXXX ( see attached email ). I look forward to receiving communication from ProCollect either 1 )  validating that this reported bill is frivolous and invalid or 2 ) the actual original invoice/bill for the final bill and cleaning fees that detail the charges assessed to me and the reasons they were assessed. The information sent by ProCollect on XX/XX/XXXX does not provide validation of the reported bill.

For the last 6 months I have been aggressively working on my credit score in order to purchase a new car in XX/XX/2019. My credit score was 27 points from reaching XXXX. Then to my surprise I receive a notification that my credit score dropped 36 points. So first pull my credit report to see what in the world could be the change because I dont have any added debt and Ive been paying all my bills on time. The issue why my credit score dropped 36 points was because on XX/XX/2019 XXXX reported to all three agencies that my student loan balance increased by {$3100.00} and then XXXX on the same day reported that my student loan increased by {$2400.00} for a total of {$5600.00} in increase debt. So I call XXXX and speak to Customer Representative # XXXX to see what was going on because I am not back in school and I havent taken any additional loans and the representative lets me know that I dont have any new student loans and there isnt an increase of {$5600.00} on my student loans there is only an increase of about {$300.00} and she doesnt know why XXXX reported an additional {$5300.00} to the credit agencies. I have attached documentation reflecting the only change in my credit report. I also called all three agencies regarding the 36 point drop and each customer representative informed me that the change is due to an increase in my debt indicated by my student loan provider of {$5600.00}. I was also told that it could take months for my score to increase by the 36 points even if XXXX  fixes the mistake. 

XXXX inaccurately report on my credit reports and why no one has caught this. The 36 point decrease has put me in a completely different credit score bracket with a completely different interest rate for the car I have been planning to purchase.

Sincerely, XXXX, XXXX SOC SEC # XXXX DOB XX/XX/XXXX ADDRESS XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX All furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies must comply with all applicableregulations. Information about applicable regulations currently in effect can be found at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's website, www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. 
NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION : OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. Sections 1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ). These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. section 1681s-2. State law may impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furnishers of information to CRAs should become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure that they are in compliance. The text of the FCRA is available at the website of the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau ( CFPB ) : www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. A list of the sections of the FCRA cross-referenced to the U.S. Code is at the end of this document.

Section 623 imposes the following duties upon furnishers : Accuracy Guidelines The FCRA requires furnishers to comply with federal guidelines and regulations dealing with the accuracy of information provided to CRAs by furnishers. Federal regulations and guidelines are available at www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. Section 623 ( e ).

General Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information The FCRA prohibits information furnishers from providing information to a CRA that they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. However, the furnisher is not subject to this general prohibition if it clearly and conspicuously specifies an address to which consumers may write to notify the furnisher that certain information is inaccurate. Sections 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( a ) ( 1 ) ( C ).

Duty to Correct and Update Information If at any time a person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs determines that the information provided is not complete or accurate, the furnisher must promptly provide complete and accurate information to the CRA. In addition, the furnisher must notify all CRAs that received the information of any corrections, and must thereafter report only the complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ).

Duties After Notice of Dispute From Consumer If a consumer notifies a furnisher, at an address specified by the furnisher for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate, and the information is, in fact, inaccurate, the furnisher must thereafter report the correct information to CRAs. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ).

If a consumer notifies a furnisher that the consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any information reported by the furnisher, the furnisher may not subsequently report that information to a CRA without providing notice of the dispute. Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ).

Furnishers must comply with federal regulations that identify when an information furnisher must investigate a dispute made directly to the furnisher by a consumer. Under these regulations, furnishers must complete an investigation within 30 days ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information ) unless the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant or comes from a "" credit repair organization. '' Section 623 ( a ) ( 8 ). Federal regulations are available at www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. Section 623 ( a ) ( 8 ).

Duties After Notice of Dispute From Consumer Reporting Agency If a CRA notifies a furnisher that a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of information provided by thefurnisher, the furnisher has a duty to follow certain procedures. The furnisher must : Conduct an investigation and review all relevant information provided by the CRA, including information given to the CRA by the consumer. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ).

Report the results to the CRA that referred the dispute, and, if the investigation establishes that the information was, in fact, incomplete or inaccurate, report the results to all CRAs to which the furnisher provided the information that compile and maintain files on a nationwide basis. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( C ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( D ).

Complete the above steps within 30 days from the date the CRA receives the dispute ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information to the CRA ). Section 623 ( b ) ( 2 ).

Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ).

Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts If a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnished information to one or more CRAs must report this fact when it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed. Section 623 ( a ) ( 4 ).

Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumer 's file. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( until there is a consumer dispute ) by reporting the same delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date can not be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information Financial institutions that furnish information to "" nationwide '' consumer reporting agencies, as defined in Section 603 ( p ), must notify consumers in writing if they may furnish or have furnished negative information to a CRA. Section 623 ( a ) ( 7 ). The CFPB has prescribed model disclosures, 12 CFR Part 1022, App. B.

Duties When Furnishing Medical Information A furnisher whose primary business is providing medical services, products, or devices ( and such furnisher 's agents or assignees ) is a medical information furnisher for the purposes of the FCRA and must notify all CRAs to which it reports of this fact. Section 623 ( a ) ( 9 ). This notice will enable CRAs to comply with their duties under Section 604 ( g ) when reporting medical information.

Duties When ID Theft Occurs All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to notifications from CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the information in the future. A furnisher may not furnish information that a consumer has identified as resulting from identity theft unless the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct. Section 623 ( a ) ( 6 ). If a furnisher learns that it has furnished inaccurate information due to identity theft, it must notify each CRA of the correct information and must thereafter report only complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ). When any furnisher of information is notified pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 605B that a debt has resulted from identity theft, the furnisher may not sell, transfer, or place for collection the debt except in certain limited circumstances. Section 615 ( f ).

02/27/2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"I have multiple accounts with Capital One, including a business checking & savings account for one of  my businesses. I attempted consolidating one of my external business accounts by opening a second business savings @ Capital One. Unbeknownst to me & without any notice, Capital One froze my business accounts simply due to requesting to open a savings account online ( which is the same way that our accounts were initially setup ). I found out about this only by calling into XXXX XXXX Cust Serv. after my business debit card was declined. During this time, I literally had no access to even see my accounts online & couldnt even see my account balances. Upon speaking with Capital One, I asked to speak with an exec level supervisor or manager to confirm whether or not our ACH deposits and payments would still be processed in spite of the temp frozen account status ; The Manager/Supervisor EMPHATICALLY confirmed MULTIPLE times that all ACH payments & deposits wouldnt be effected by this status and that they would FOR SURE still be processed per usual. Therefore, I didnt have a reason to make other arrangements for our outgoing payments and inbound deposits. However, I was given false information by the aforementioned manager & all of our deposits & payments were rejected. Consequently, our largest personal loan account was reported as being 30 days late, we lost a premium domain potentially worth several thousands of dollars, our business was ( and still is ) reported to XXXX ( which has caused several rejected ACH payment fees ) - and all of this due to this payment not going through, in spite of being given a definitive guarantee that it would absolutely go through. Additionally, due to the 30 day late payment status, our loan account was now subject to several thousands of dollars in retroactive interest charges. I immediately contacted Capital One & they accepted responsibility for the error and guaranteed to compensate us for any losses due to their error and that they would do so in a timely manner. Unfortunately & to our continued detriment, Capital One didnt stand behind this guarantee/promise, in spite of us sending countless documentation supporting our losses. I sent countless emails to their executive office and to the general counsel, but didnt receive a response for almost 2 months at one point, at which time they offered us $ XXXX  for a matter that has cost us far more up to this point and will ultimately end up costing in excess of $ 50- $ 60k +. Due to Capital Ones continued inaction, our loan account is now standing at 120 days past due with a balance of just over $ 12k and our credit has now crept just below 600 ( our scores have always been well over 700+ ). Further, two of our current creditors have significantly reduced our credit line ( 1. XXXX it XXXX - {$26000.00} reduced to {$10000.00} 2. XXXX XXXX  of XXXX XXXX XXXX - {$7000.00} closed by creditor due to very recent and significant delinquency reported ). This is now creating problems for my business, as we used the XXXX XXXX for an on-file Card for our largest Equipment wholesaler and now we are maxed out, which caused our utilization % to balloon from 20-25 % to 80 % +. I have spoke to Capital Ones retained attorney through XXXX XXXX and have provided all supporting documentation, including info directly from our credit report & directly from XXXX, yet I am still being subjected to methodical delays and evasive tactics by Capital One, all while being subjected to what has been a snowball effect due to how long Capital One is taking to do what they promised they would do. I have consulted with our attorney and in order to simply begin the litigation process, we would be required to pay a $ XXXX retainer fee. I feel as if we are now being disrespected more and more each day that Capital One fails to make good on their promise of compensating for their admitted errors. Lastly, my wife is XXXX XXXX XXXX and this is adding stress that she shouldnt be subjected to during this important stage of her XXXX, yet Capital One has essentially implied that they could care less, which I can only assume is because they have no one to hold them accountable for mistakes that they openly and expressly admitted ( and did so in writing via a signed & notarized statement that I requested in an attempt to mitigate further losses ). I have requested additional information from their attorney and they continue to act as if they just dont care to hear my requests. I understand that there are likely hundreds of claims that are without any merit whatsoever and I have been consistently reminded of this by Capital Ones attorneys, but I have provided ample ( even excessive & certainly repititive ) documentation to substantiate my losses, unequivocally speaking. The ridiculous part about all of this is that it all stems from me requesting to do something as simple as opening a 2nd Savings Account and trying to bring an additional $ XXXX on deposit with their bank. We have absolutely ZERO culpability in this matter whatsoever, as we simply requested to open the aforementioned 2nd savings. Please provide assistance ASAP, as this has now been ongoing for nearly 7 months now.

Those responsibilities include ceasing to provide inaccurate information to any CRAs and ensuring that you do not attempt to sell or transfer the fraudulent debts to another party for collection. 
Please investigate this matter, close the account and absolve me of all charges, take the steps required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and send me a letter explaining your findings and actions. 
Please understand as well that under the FCRA any "" furnisher of information '' must put the account rating on hold while the debt, is being investigated and remove all negative remarks added to my credit report. Continuing to report this disputed debt to my credit reports is an FCRA violation also open to damages collected from you by me.

Please be advised that this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 { b } that your claim is disputed and validation is requested.

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above-named Title & Section. I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you.

Please provide me with the following : What the money you say I owe is for : Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe : Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe : Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable : Identify the original creditor : Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account : Show me the you are licensed to collect in my state : Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent or Agent of Service : At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus { XXXX, XXXX  or XXXX } this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent, I will not hesitate to bring legal action against you for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character If your offices are able to provide proper documentation as requested in the following Declaration, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. 


Also, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit. This includes listing any information with a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate, when in fact there is no provided proof that it is accurate. 



If your company fails to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit report and a copy of such deletion { to any/all of the 3 major credit reporting bureaus : XXXX, XXXX and XXXX } request shall be sent to me immediately.

I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your company to my home or my place of employment.

02/27/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with rewards from credit card,"Since I opened a XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card with Synchrony Bank, I have had nothing but problems with the "" Reward Dollars '', which are the credits that you receive when you purchase items from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Every single month, Synchrony has either not given me the correct number of reward dollars I am due or not given me any of the reward dollars I am due. Each month, I call and complain and they eventually recognize the mistake, though it takes "" an investigation '' and an additional billing cycle for them to correct it. 

This month, on XXXX, I spent {$1000.00} and should have received the usual 10 % in rewards ( {$100.00} ). I received no rewards for this purchase ( the statement says something about this purchase being a "" deferred interest '' purchase but I have no idea what that means, as I did not ask for any special payment terms at the time of the purchase and I paid the balance in full the day I received the statement. ) On XXXX, I spent {$53.00} during a "" double points '' weekend and should have received a {$10.00} in rewards points. I received only half of these reward points. In total, I should have received {$110.00} points this month ( {$100.00} plus {$10.00} ). I received {$5.00}. When I called, Synchrony, once again, recognized the mistake but said I had to wait another billing cycle to have it corrected.

To make matters worse, the rewards "" balance '' total on the statement doesn't align with the rewards balance on the home page. The statement shows a prior balance of {$11.00} then adds the ( incorrect ) {$5.00} earned this month for a new rewards total of {$16.00}. However, my account on the web page shows a "" previous reward balance of {$16.00} + {$5.00} earned this period ( I have no idea where this comes from ) - {$20.00} reward certificate ( which was never issued to me ) for a balance of {$2.00}. None of this makes any sense.

I have had credit cards for thirty years and have never had problems like this. It seems to me that this is their business model- to have a flawed/confusing reward system in the hopes that a large portion of people will not notice or will not take the time to have it corrected. It is not rocket science to have rewards accurately reflected on statements or, at worst, corrected in real time.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,DC,,,Consent provided,Web,02/27/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3164371
02/27/2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,Since XX/XX/XXXX or so I hold a checking a savings a money market about XXXX CDs and an investment account with Ally. as well as an Ally credit card. For the past 4 months Ive paid my Ally CC with my Ally checking account almost in full with balances ranging from 3 to 4 thousand dollars. For the past 4 months Ally has held my payment for almost 10 days. In other words it gets debited from my checking the next day but does not get applied to my CC as a payment for almost 10 days. So for the past 4 months Ive had to call Ally on the phone and inform them that I need the hold released. This has been time consuming and frustrating. yesterday XX/XX/XXXX about XXXX I placed another of these calls for my XXXX  dollar payment to be released. I was on hold for one rep to do a conference call with the other rep and once the Ally bank rep got on the line with me and the CC  rep the process of authentication began again with my security questions which all were answered correctly with the help of my daughter. I am a XXXX XXXX who greatly relies on my daughter and son to remind me of my security questions as well as my doctors appointments my medication schedule and any other detail or information I find difficult to recall. So the Ally bank rep stated she Heard someone in the background giving me the security questions information. to which I said Thats my daughter. The rep said that was not allowed. I explained to her what I just explained to you the reason is my recollection difficulty. The rep then said she would have to email me a security code. I told her I am out of the house and dont have access to my email which is on my computer. I do not email on my phone. She asked for my phone number. I told her I changed my phone number middle of XXXX from XXXX to XXXX XXXX so the number she has on file is no longer mine. I told her I dont need a code since I answered all the security questions correctly. She said I wasnt authenticated. I obviously then became upset since The main reason I was on the phone with these two reps was to release my XXXX  dollar payment which Ive had to do for the past 4 months. I told the rep this is frustrating and I will be closing my CC account as well as ending my banking relationship with Ally. The phone call ended. This was about XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. At XXXX the same day when I finally arrived home from a stressed day which I had spent with a dear friend suffering from XXXX I log on to Ally bank online and discover my account is LOCKED. I immediately call the bank and after authenticating my account am told that my account has been referred to a specialist and they will contact me in XXXX to XXXX business days. I tell the rep thats unacceptable and wish to speak with a supervisor. I spoke with XXXX who tells me the specialists go home at XXXX and I have to call back the next day which is today XX/XX/XXXX. I called today about XXXX request the golden specialist and after being on hold for XXXX  minutes waiting for this specialist the rep comes back on the line and tells me the specialist has to contact me. I can not initiate the contact to resolve my account being locked. ALL my accounts are locked. There is no way for me to transfer funds between accounts and my CC is being denied every single time. The level of hardship this has caused me is debilitating. Having no money to put gas in my car buy groceries transfer funds from my savings to my checking account to cover the property tax checks I wrote yesterday. I can go on. As a senior citizen I felt I was discriminated against by a rep who has no comprehension or understanding of what it it means to be XXXX with a XXXX XXXX I can understand the security protocol however this was not the issue. If my account was to be compromised or if I had a XXXX to my head does the bank think the person stealing my money would be giving me the answers.

02/27/2019,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was already discharged in bankruptcy and is no longer owed,"On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX contacted my sister-in-law in an attempt to reach me. They provided her with a reference number, a phone number, and mentioned it was a litigation matter. I received the information from her and contacted Integrity. 

I was put in touch with XXXX at XXXX. She informed me that she had just received my account that morning and was trying to reach me to discuss the matter. I asked her to not contact my sister-in-law again and she confirmed my number. I questioned her on this being the first attempt to contact me as the number provided to me was in my call history ; the company had made previous attempts to reach me prior to the XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX assured me this wasn't the case as she had just received the account that morning. She stated that she was attempting to collect on an account on behalf of HSBC Consumer Lending from XX/XX/XXXX for {$1300.00}. I asked why I did not receive any physical mail about the collection efforts. XXXX told me XXXX only had the account for 3 weeks and she did not control what the mail department does in mailing out account details. 

I asked her to send me the information so I can review it and to include an address and account information for payments. She informed me they only take payments over the phone or thru the use of a prepaid card. I told her my discomfort and reluctance about providing debit/credit card information over the phone. 

I remembered I had an account with HSBC thru Beneficial but not in XX/XX/XXXX. I began to question the debt 's authenticity and she threatened to serve me at home or work with a court summons suing me for the debt. XXXX mentioned she was authorized to offer me a settlement of a payment schedule for a reduction of the balance. 


Once I began to ask questions to gather information about the debt, she became hostile and immediately stated she was putting me down as a refusal which meant this matter was going to court. I asked her wasn't she obligated to discuss settlement terms before she put me down as a refusal. I mentioned I was only trying to get information about the debt since Integrity 's policy is to not send out mail. 


XXXX put me on hold. After a brief delay, she came back on line and told me her supervisors were listening to the call and that she should discuss the settlement terms. She then mentioned that the HSBC account was actually from XX/XX/XXXX and that the account had been placed into collections in XX/XX/XXXX. 


She mentioned I needed to agree to the settlement that day only and had to consent in an email thru electronic signature on a form from them sent via email. I acknowledged that I had an account with HSBC but it was included in a XX/XX/XXXX bankruptcy and therefore the debt was no longer valid. 


We ended the call her and I contacted the attorney that handled my bankruptcy to discuss this matter. I talked to a clerk and discussed this matter and the above mentioned recollection of events. I provided XXXX 's number and left it there. I contacted XXXX and provided my attorney 's information and that the matter is to be directed to the attorney. My attorney informed me that she would provide Integrity with proof of the bankruptcy. 



My real issue is how and why did XXXX XXXX come into possession of this account considering it was discharged thru a bankruptcy. I contacted HSBC and they had no information attached to my social security number thus no active attempts to collect the debt. The aggressive nature of XXXX 's collection attempts, immediate refusal of offering a prestated settlement in lieu of me asking informative questions, and the threats of litigation were abusive in nature and combative. Due to the fraudulent attempts to collect and to avoid litigation, I felt immediate pressure to pay the settlement amount on the XX/XX/XXXX and even made a transfer of funds in my accounts to pay the {$750.00} settlement.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,PA,153XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/05/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3164241

I submitted my response to Flagstar via the website on XX/XX/XXXX and also mailed a hard copy of the response as well. In my response, I explained my confusion regarding the missing items and items being requested that werent in the instructions and asked for clarification. We then received three more notices of incomplete application stating they had received additional information, however, our application was still incomplete ( notices dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ). We then received a letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that our file had been closed because they had not received critical information necessary to complete our application. I called Flagstar the next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and spoke to a representative who read me a list of errors with what was submitted, which included : the hardship letter was missing the co-borrowers signature, co-borrower has signed the 4506-T EZ form in the wrong place, they needed an unemployment award letter and two months of bank statements showing the unemployment deposits and tax returns for one of the borrowers. NONE of these errors were included in the Notice of Incomplete Application Notice. When I asked if the representative could provide the errors in writing, I was told Flagstar doesnt send personalized letters. The representative was unable to tell me if the errors were corrected would application be processed or would we need to submit an entirely new application. 

I was proactive and responsive to all of Flagstars requests, yet the information they provided was extremely inaccurate and not helpful. Even if I were to go through the entire process again, how I am I to correct what I dont know I did wrong and if the requirements for what needs to be submitted isnt clear in the instructions?

02/27/2019,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Problem when making payments,,"PayPal credit has been actively unhelpful and negligent in handling a 3rd part ( XXXX ) credit obligation setup on my PayPal account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a purchase via XXXX for an item for which I opted for XXXX 's "" 12 Easy Payments '' offer totalling {$2400.00}. As a result, this XXXX "" Credit '' was rolled into a Paypal Credit account, ( I had no Credit account with Paypal prior to this XXXX purchase ). From the beginning, this arrangement has been riddled with misinformation and lack of transparency. I first contacted Paypal Credit after reviewing my first Paypal Credit statement on XX/XX/XXXX indicating that my XXXX purchase was being charged interest from the moment I made the purchase of XX/XX/XXXX ( {$5.00} incurred during the 5 day statement period ). This is not what I had believed my terms to have been, so I attempted to contact Paypal Credit regarding my concerns. Initially, I was redirected by a representative to XXXX for more information regarding terms ( because, I was told, this was something that Paypal Credit only administered and had no other info ) before being bounced back to Paypal Credit and a new representative who informed that, yes, Paypal is in fact the administrator to contact on this item. It was at this point in time that I was made aware of the interest calculation being applied to my account ( accrued daily from the time of purchase ). Eager to get this item paid off due to the terms that I did not feel comfortable with, I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX to clear off as much of the balance as possible. I was told that there was nothing Paypal could do and that I had consented to the terms as outlined. Up until this point, I can say with sincerity that while I was a bit surprised by the reliance on fine print to explain what I had initially thought was a simple purchase and promo offer, I would not characterize my interaction with Paypal as negligent. However, every interaction following my next call with a Paypal Credit representative the following week on XX/XX/XXXX I would now characterize as negligent. It was on this call on XX/XX/XXXX, now made aware of the interest terms that apply to my XX/XX/XXXX charge, that I explicitly requested a dollar figure from the support rep that would close out this balance and obligation. I was informed by the rep of that amount total ( {$470.00} ), and authorized that payment over the phone. Since that date, I have since received my newest statement dated XX/XX/XXXX with the line item still listed and a partial balance remaining on the item in question. After talking with one representative on XX/XX/XXXX, who was totally unaware of the terms as they apply for a 3rd party offer such as mine, I was misinformed that I was not being charged interest on my item and told that I misunderstood the terms. I knew this to be incorrect ( I had already paid a total amount to Paypal beyond the purchase amount, so this was indisputable ), so I requested that I be transferred to someone more knowledgeable of this transaction type. After explaining the situation to the Supervisor,  I was informed that the payment made with a service rep over the phone on XX/XX/XXXX was not applied in a way that would fully cover the total balance due. I informed the supervisor that I explicitly requested that that be done, and that the rep unequivocally confirmed that to be the case. I asked whether the interest incurred since that payment could be waived given the clear error. She said it could not be waived. I then asked how could I confirm that any new payment I were to make would be properly allotted so that the balance would clear. She informed me that Paypal Credit is unable to provide any documentation that confirms this action, and that as the supervisor that this would be done correctly. I informed her that I would be contacting any and all consumer protection bureaus regarding what I considered to be negligent behavior and mishandling of my account ( by providing me with incorrect or misinformed information in nearly every interaction I've had with Paypal Credit since the account was setup ) that has cost me interest incurred with no acknowledgement of error.

For the last 6 months I have been aggressively working on my credit score in order to purchase a new car in XX/XX/2019. My credit score was 27 points from reaching XXXX. Then to my surprise I receive a notification that my credit score dropped 36 points. So first pull my credit report to see what in the world could be the change because I dont have any added debt and Ive been paying all my bills on time. The issue why my credit score dropped 36 points was because on XX/XX/2019 Navient reported to all three agencies that my student loan balance increased by {$3100.00} and then Navient on the same day reported that my student loan increased by {$2400.00} for a total of {$5600.00} in increase debt. So I call Navient and speak to Customer Representative # XXXX to see what was going on because I am not back in school and I havent taken any additional loans and the representative lets me know that I dont have any new student loans and there isnt an increase of {$5600.00} on my student loans there is only an increase of about {$300.00} and she doesnt know why Navient reported an additional {$5300.00} to the credit agencies. I have attached documentation reflecting the only change in my credit report. I also called all three agencies regarding the 36 point drop and each customer representative informed me that the change is due to an increase in my debt indicated by my student loan provider of {$5600.00}. I was also told that it could take months for my score to increase by the 36 points even if Navient fixes the mistake. 

Navient inaccurately report on my credit reports and why no one has caught this. The 36 point decrease has put me in a completely different credit score bracket with a completely different interest rate for the car I have been planning to purchase.

For the last 6 months I have been aggressively working on my credit score in order to purchase a new car in XX/XX/2019. My credit score was 27 points from reaching XXXX. Then to my surprise I receive a notification that my credit score dropped 36 points. So first pull my credit report to see what in the world could be the change because I dont have any added debt and Ive been paying all my bills on time. The issue why my credit score dropped 36 points was because on XX/XX/2019 XXXX reported to all three agencies that my student loan balance increased by {$3100.00} and then XXXX on the same day reported that my student loan increased by {$2400.00} for a total of {$5600.00} in increase debt. So I call XXXX and speak to Customer Representative # XXXX to see what was going on because I am not back in school and I havent taken any additional loans and the representative lets me know that I dont have any new student loans and there isnt an increase of {$5600.00} on my student loans there is only an increase of about {$300.00} and she doesnt know why XXXX  reported an additional {$5300.00} to the credit agencies. I have attached documentation reflecting the only change in my credit report. I also called all three agencies regarding the 36 point drop and each customer representative informed me that the change is due to an increase in my debt indicated by my student loan provider of {$5600.00}. I was also told that it could take months for my score to increase by the 36 points even if XXXX  fixes the mistake. 

XXXX inaccurately report on my credit reports and why no one has caught this. The 36 point decrease has put me in a completely different credit score bracket with a completely different interest rate for the car I have been planning to purchase. This error affects me in the long run and my financial well being. I need a person to give me a call to resolve this.

02/27/2019,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I applied to Navient for their private loan permanent rate reduction program due to my inability to pay the astronomical rates they were charging me. As a reference, I am a prior student/victim of the XXXX XXXX predatory student lending scams. They approved my interest rate reduction to 1 % for ALL my private student loans and I have been making on time payments ever since. I had been making two separate payments for five different loans ; one for about {$140.00} on three of them, and one for about {$64.00} on two of them, the sum equaling roughly {$200.00}. This was a long arduous process to which took about two months of negotiation and was finalized sometime in XX/XX/XXXX. I received a notice in XX/XX/XXXX, that my payment status had changed. They said that two of the five loans were no longer in this interest reduction program. After 2.5 hours and arguing, pushing, and inquiring with several "" specialists '' that this was not right because this change was supposed to be permanent for all five loans, they finally combed through my account and realized this was a clerical error on their end. They said they would rectify the account, erase the late fees and put all five loans under one payment within the rate reduction program as it was originally supposed to have been processed two years ago. During this process I lost time from work sorting this out on the phone. Before the call I received no notice on this change. They assessed late fees and my interest rates sky-rocketed which pushed my loan amount up and thus effected my credit negatively. They kept insisting that this was always what was going to happen yet they could not provide proof to me that this was the agreement but consistently tried to push me off the phone, dismissing me as if I was being ridiculous. Once they finally realized their error they said that moving forward all five loans would be under one payment of the same amount from before, approximately {$200.00} as they are all under the same program. But I just received a statement saying that the late fees are still be assessed for {$35.00}. The payments were still processed as two separate payments and not just one as they stated. This concerns me in that despite what they said, the clerical error is obviously still present. This is not the first time I have had an issue in dealing with the incompetence of Navient in their loan servicing. I should not have to push and dig to get answers and to correct THEIR errors. I should not have to continually communicate with a large corporation to which has the financial means to maintain their clerical staff and systems efficiently, and that should also not put lower middle-class citizens like me through the rigor morale every single time they falter. I only wonder if this happens to me, what about the plenty of other blue-collar citizens who don't have the wherewithal to push like I do. Does Navient perform quality assurance checks? Do they get audited where small clerical mistakes like this cost student loan holders thousands of dollars they already don't have beyond what they owe? Are these financial mishaps recompensed to those who overpaid due to Navient 's error? Lastly, I caught this one, what if I didn't catch others? Please audit this company. Please scrutinize their billing efforts. Stop letting this happen to good people who just want to do the right thing and pay what they owe but still want to have some quality of life where they aren't being cheated by big money hungry corporations.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",PA,194XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,02/27/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3165002

The company denied telling me to prove the payments once I had the documents needed, taking all late payments in full interest.

In the following week I received a letter that my account was going to be in default again. I contacted them after realizing my credit score went down XXXX points. When I spoke to them they I made arrangements to repay the amount. Toward the end of XXXX I called to make sure my XXXX tax form was in the mail. As time passed on XX/XX/XXXX I still haven't received my tax form so I contacted them again and a representative of the company said my form was mailed out. I waited for another week and my form has not arrived. So on XX/XX/XXXX I called and wanted my forms to be mailed they said I could just do my taxes they told me the amount and I refused and said I need my forms that I would like for it to be overnight and this time the manager said that's not going to happen. Now it's XX/XX/XXXX and my tax forms still haven't arrived. At this point I have no idea what my options are.

02/27/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"Complaint - PHH Mortgage Service I am communicating this complaint in regards to a Refinance cash out of an investment property which started the week of XX/XX/2019 from XXXX XXXX who then completely went over all of my required information and verified my reserves of {$17000.00}, before moving to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2019. Mr . XXXX further processed my application. During this process, and procedure all information was again verified and approved before submitting the verifications of reserves funds with the under writer department. Remember in the beginning, I was already verified for having {$1700.00} in reserves which was required, however the underwriter department requested {$30000.00}. Now this seem strange and all of sudden, I asked XXXX XXXX to have underwriter to go over their numbers again because I knew the amount was {$17000.00}, which they did. The next day, it was confirmed {$17000.00}. Well this brought red flags with me in believing they was not processing my application fairly. Then the underwriters department asked to verified my reserves which I used the information which Mr. XXXX used, my bank savings accounts, my XXXX XXXX   investment plan as well as my XXXX XXXX account. Underwriters came back and said they could not use the XXXX  account nor the XXXX XXXX account, stating they do not grant credit to any terms and conditions requested. The terms and condition they were talking about is the disclosure statement showing that I am the account Holder irregardless of others on the account and if I ever needed the funds I would be penalized for 10 % plus State and Federal Tax prematurely which would not have an affect on them just me. This is standard on any IRA, Roth, retirement savings etc. They opted for this, without stating the guidelines under XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, to justify. So I researched the Guidelines, and it stated funds that can not be withdrawn under circumstances owners retirement, employment termination, or death can not be counted as part of the borrowers reserves. Their guidelines listed whats acceptable source of reserves and Unacceptable source of reserves. In orders words the XXXX investment plan can be used and they decided on their own not to. Unacceptable. Retraining is needed here. 

Further, I have been with this company for many years and they handled two of my loans if a company, cant satisfy their customers fairly then customers dont need their servicing because of unfair practices. I hereby request an investigation into PHH mortgage Loan process particularly their underwriters department in processing refinance loans and the reserves verification.",,PHH Mortgage Services Corporation,MD,207XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,02/27/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3164848

But on the report it doesn't state why my payments were delinquent. I am always on top of my loan and debt repayments ; however, ACS is an unreliable company which makes repayments almost impossible. My loans first became due on XX/XX/XXXX. Since that day until XXXX of XXXX, I made several attempts to repay my loans by either visiting their website or calling them. Whenever I visited ACS 's website I encountered a message claiming that "" service is unavailable ''. This happened every single time I visited their website. Since, repayments through website was obviously not a solution, I attempted calling the company on various days at various times. I would either receive a busy tone, or the call would keep ringing without anyone ever responding. To investigate this further, I called XXXX University 's loan and financial department, and a represintive went over different possibilities. They told me that ACS often has these problems, and it is very like that they are changing the service provider for those loans, and I shouldn't worry about. That was a relief to hear as ACS seemed very shady in the way they conducted business. Unavailable website and customer service can be very very alarming. This company has wasted a lot of my time from writing this complaint, calling them, visiting their website, etc. I shouldn't chase after them and waste every day of my life to hopefully catch their uptime. This is unreasonable. 

On XXXX of XXXX, I was able to access their website, and realized they are still handling my loan. Their website 's interface is not intuitive and errs on the simplest actions and inputs. Even with all these obstacles, the first thing I did was to setup ACH so that they could directly transfer money from my bank account. Again, this was the first thing that I did to prevent any delinquent repayments in the future. I believe the way that ACS handled my case is absolutely wrong and bizarre, since they provided no medium for me to take care of my repayments at all. ACS 's business is very concerning and suspicious. No transparent communications, no website, and no customer service. Even as I am writing this the website is unavailable. However, this time it doesn't even show any messages, the website just doesn't load at all. I have tried to load the website in different browsers and still no luck. I have attached the picture of one of the instances when I visited the company 's website to make a payment. This problem was so frequent, I took a screenshot.

Report the results to the CRA that referred the dispute, and, if the investigation establishes that the information was, in fact, incomplete or inaccurate, report the results to all CRAs to which the furnisher provided the information that compile and maintain files on a nationwide basis. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( C ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( D ).

Complete the above steps within 30 days from the date the CRA receives the dispute ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information to the CRA ). Section 623 ( b ) ( 2 ).

Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ).

Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts If a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnished information to one or more CRAs must report this fact when it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed. Section 623 ( a ) ( 4 ).

Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumer 's file. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( until there is a consumer dispute ) by reporting the same delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date can not be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information Financial institutions that furnish information to "" nationwide '' consumer reporting agencies, as defined in Section 603 ( p ), must notify consumers in writing if they may furnish or have furnished negative information to a CRA.

Duties When Furnishing Medical Information A furnisher whose primary business is providing medical services, products, or devices ( and such furnisher 's agents or assignees ) is a medical information furnisher for the purposes of the FCRA and must notify all CRAs to which it reports of this fact. Section 623 ( a ) ( 9 ). This notice will enable CRAs to comply with their duties under Section 604 ( g ) when reporting medical information.

Duties When ID Theft Occurs All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to notifications from CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the information in the future. A furnisher may not furnish information that a consumer has identified as resulting from identity theft unless the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct. Section 623 ( a ) ( 6 ). If a furnisher learns that it has furnished inaccurate information due to identity theft, it must notify each CRA of the correct information and must thereafter report only complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ). When any furnisher of information is notified pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 605B that a debt has resulted from identity theft, the furnisher may not sell, transfer, or place for collection the debt except in certain limited circumstances. Section 615 ( f ).

But on the report it doesn't state why my payments were delinquent. I am always on top of my loan and debt repayments ; however, XXXX is an unreliable company which makes repayments almost impossible. My loans first became due on XX/XX/XXXX. Since that day until XXXX of XXXX, I made several attempts to repay my loans by either visiting their website or calling them. Whenever I visited XXXX 's website I encountered a message claiming that "" service is unavailable ''. This happened every single time I visited their website. Since, repayments through website was obviously not a solution, I attempted calling the company on various days at various times. I would either receive a busy tone, or the call would keep ringing without anyone ever responding. To investigate this further, I called XXXX University 's loan and financial department, and a represintive went over different possibilities. They told me that XXXX often has these problems, and it is very like that they are changing the service provider for those loans, and I shouldn't worry about. That was a relief to hear as XXXX seemed very shady in the way they conducted business. Unavailable website and customer service can be very very alarming. This company has wasted a lot of my time from writing this complaint, calling them, visiting their website, etc. I shouldn't chase after them and waste every day of my life to hopefully catch their uptime. This is unreasonable. 

On XXXX of XXXX, I was able to access their website, and realized they are still handling my loan. Their website 's interface is not intuitive and errs on the simplest actions and inputs. Even with all these obstacles, the first thing I did was to setup ACH so that they could directly transfer money from my bank account. Again, this was the first thing that I did to prevent any delinquent repayments in the future. I believe the way that XXXX handled my case is absolutely wrong and bizarre, since they provided no medium for me to take care of my repayments at all. XXXX 's business is very concerning and suspicious. No transparent communications, no website, and no customer service. Even as I am writing this the website is unavailable. However, this time it doesn't even show any messages, the website just doesn't load at all. I have tried to load the website in different browsers and still no luck. I have attached the picture of one of the instances when I visited the company 's website to make a payment. This problem was so frequent, I took a screenshot.

02/26/2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I am reaching out to Consumer Financial Protecttion Bureau regarding an issue with my Escrow Account through Loancare. 

I contacted them by e-mail on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX Below is the e-mail sent to the company : Good afternoon, I am reaching out to LoanCare regarding our Escrow Shortage. 

I received an escrow statement informing myself and my husband that we acquired an escrow shortage. The year prior we did not incur an escrow shortage. That figure should have been in place to ensure that the escrow account acquired proper funding to pay all necessary mortgage fees. The escrow amount was altered the beginning of XXXX which resulted in a shortage of funds. I confided in LoanCare to calculate escrow to cover all expenses to include MPI, city and county taxes, as well as Home Owners Insurance. LoanCare has failed to calculate the escrow accordingly. I feel I should not be penalized for a mistake LoanCare made. 

I refuse to make a payment on the escrow shortage until I receive an explanation as to why there was a deficit on our escrow account. Additionally, the shortage that appeared on the statement was incorrect as well. 

The breakdown of the costs which our escrow account pays are as follows : XXXX Home Owner 's Insurance XXXX City Tax XXXX County Tax XXXX MPI Total : {$3000.00} The total amount of contributions to our escrow account for 12 months is : XXXX ( year XXXX ) {$2800.00} Shortage of escrow ( XXXX ) : {$230.00} The new escrow amount of {$250.00} ( year XXXX ) will result in yet again, another shortage for the upcoming year. 

Please explain what method was used to result in the {$330.00} figure that is referenced to our escrow shortage. 

As of today 's date, I have never received a response. I attempted to contact them by phone, only to receive a message of "" If this is normal business hours, we apologize for the inconvenience. '' Shortly after, there was a disconnect. 

I would like to discuss my Escrow account as the Escrow Loancare is stating is due is not the correct amount. 

The year prior, our escrow amount covered all disbursements. However, after lowering the escrow payment, we now are forced to pay a shortage. 

In addition, Loancare disabled our online account due to being in Bankruptcy. With that being said, they allowed us to pay our mortgage online for 4 years of bankruptcy, after than point they realized that we were not allowed to pay our mortgage online since we are in bankruptcy. I find this rather concerning that after 4 years they finally noticed the error. 

I would like a response from Loancare regarding the discrepancy in our Escrow Shortage. 

Thank you for your time.

According to Maryland Code, Commercial Law 1-103, the age of majority is 18 years old in Maryland and anyone under 18 can not be legally bound to a contract unless they are legally emancipated, which I can assure you I was not.

I also want proof of this debt, showing the contract where I supposedly signed my name and consented for my own treatment, within 30 days. To attempt to collect the debt on which the creditor can not show a contract or an underlying basis would violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

According the FDCPA under Unfair Practices [ 15 USC 1692f ] : A debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section : ( 1 ) The collection of any amount ( including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation ) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.

A timeline of incidents as follows : XX/XX/XXXX The building we moved in to was completed and Certification of Occupancy was granted by the city of XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX - We closed on our condo in that building. 
XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX transferred our mortgage to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing XX/XX/XXXX - Shellpoint Mortgage incorrectly paid the XXXX XXXX taxes for the original two parcels that our building stands upon for {$19000.00}. Because the building just received its certification of occupancy in XXXX of XXXX, each unit had not been assigned its own Parcel at that point. There at 34 units in the building. Shellpoint mortgage paid the taxes for all 34 units. 
XX/XX/XXXX - We became aware of the tax issue and informed Shellpoint by telephone. We were informed that a resolution ticket was opened with the Shellpoint Mortgage tax department. 
XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX - I've called roughly 50 different times to get an update on the status of resolution, but nothing has materialized. 
XX/XX/XXXX - We received notice that our monthly payment would be increased by {$2400.00} to pay down our incorrectly applied - $ XXXX escrow balance. We called Shellpoint immediately to inform them of the mistake. We were told that another escalated ticket was opened internally to handle the mistake. We stopped auto payment until the issue was resolved. 
XX/XX/XXXX ( cont. ) - We received notice that Shellpoint will be transferring our loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  effective XX/XX/XXXX. 

Our primary concern is that with the hand off to the new lender, this issue will not be resolved appropriately, especially if the new lender doesnt have the detailed history of this issue and our correspondence. Ive been assured dozens of times over the last year that this issue will be resolved, but it has not.

02/26/2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Unable to open an account,"Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I was excited to open a business account for the 1st time. I thought I had all my documents, but I was missing my EIN number. XXXX told me I could get the IRS to fax the information to bank. But in the meantime, he could set-up my personal account. While he was doing that, I was looking up the IRS number on my phone. When I got on the IRS web page it would not let me click the number to dial. So, I got XXXX 's sticky note cards on his desk write the number down. 

I call the IRS but shortly hung-up because the lady that was assisting XXXX told me that she another number which was essential the same number I JUST dialed previous. 

I was a bit aggravated because I was already waiting on hold for 7 minutes and I had another appointment to attend XXXX XXXX. I gather my things and left. 

Few hours later I got a call from XXXX asking, I did I accidentally grip a business card when I was gathering my things? 

So, I search my car, purse, wallet but I didn't see it. I give him a call back to confirm told him I'll be back on Friday to finish the business account. 

Friday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX 2nd try to open the business account. When I arrived, I told the lady at the front desk I wanted to open a business account and I have the IRS on the line to fax my EIN. The lady that was helping me didn't even know the bank had a fax machine. The was the 1st flag! The IRS confirm the fax was sent the 2 lady claimed they didn't receive it. So they provide me with another fax number the IRS confirmed again it was send. The lady received it but didn't see my personal profile set-up yet and XXXX had to finish it to gain credit for the account. 2nd red flag! I was under the impression XXXX set-up my personal account on Tuesday as he stated ... ... 

I go to XXXX 's desk. He asked me look through my purse again for the business card. I did and I found it in my wallet mixed in with the other business cards, I apologized and gave it back to him. In my mind it was a total accident. No big deal. Suddenly, the lady from Tuesday that give me the same number for the IRS comes over and accuses me of stealing a business card and needed an explanation. I told it was a total mistaken it was NOT intentional. XXXX and this lady when back and forth with me over a BUSINESS CARD of a PERSON I DO NOT KNOW or CARE to KNOW!!!! They were asking why would I do that? Why would I take bank property information? We saw the cameras and saw you put it in your purse. AS IF I WAS A CRIMINAL!!! They made me feel like I was a THIEF and discriminated against! 

I'm TELLING THESE FOLKS IT WAS A PURE ACCIDENT!!!! WHY WOULD WANT BUSINESS CARD FROM SOMEONE I DO NOT KNOW!!! They are in cahoots together saying we are trying to know why too. During this process, I felt harassed and discriminated against. After all of that they asked me are you sure you still want to open your account with us. Red flag number 3!!! Deep inside I didn't because I thought those actions were not called for but .... 

Since I just drove from XXXX XXXX, GA to XXXX, GA during my lunch break, was on hold with the IRS for 35 minutes to get my EIN faxed and I had ALL my paperwork I just needed my account now so I could go! 

They XXXX started acting like my EIN number was not valid even though the IRS JUST FAXED .... 

After an hour and a half later, he provides me with a rejection letter stating they can not open my account with no indication of why!!!!! 

NOW, I FEEL LIKE THIS IS DEEPER MATTER AND I FEEL BEING WRONGFULLY TARGETED!!!

02/26/2019,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem when making payments,,"I have a complaint with Synchrony Bank, regarding my CareCredit account. First, I will admit I have been delinquent on my account and I am not denying I have fallen behind regarding even my minimum payments. After living in XXXX XXXX for 20 years, I moved out because it has become too expensive to live there over the years. I moved to the outer area of XXXX, OH, and living with my elderly father to assist him since he is alone but does not need a caretaker. 

After I arrived, I attempted to call Synchrony to make payment arrangements to make some payment on my account. I had received a letter regarding that my account had been forwarded to a collections agency. On XX/XX/18, I attempted to call the collections company, but no luck as the agent I was talking to didnt seem to understand English as I had repeated my name five times - even spelling it, and the person still could not comprehend what I was telling him or her, for I couldnt tell. Frustrated, I then called Synchrony Bank directly to make contact and was able to get through. The person I spoke with understood me and seemed like she knew what she was doing, not an offshore call center and she sounded older. I let her know my financial situation at the time, that I would be making payments on my account but I wasnt exactly sure when exactly I would be making them. But at least one {$100.00} payment on my account in the next month. She continued to notate on my account, and asked me if I could make two payments around certain dates ; I agreed to making two payments in the month of XX/XX/2018. I gave her a ballpark idea of dates since I was unemployed ; she set actual dates I needed to make payment by : XX/XX/18 and XX/XX/18, but never let on as those being exact set dates. This whole time, I stated with the assumption I was making an old school, promise-to-pay on my account and that I would be making the two {$100.00} payments myself online, not permitting Synchrony to automatically take two {$100.00} payments in XX/XX/2018 on set dates. She also verified my account information, including my checking account was still the same. 

So thinking I was late with my first payment, I made an online payment myself XX/XX/18 to Synchrony for {$100.00}. A few days later XX/XX/18, another payment for {$100.00} was processed by Synchrony automatically and not by me. I didnt notice this for at least a week, and was baffled how that happened. I went online XX/XX/18 and removed my checking account information to prevent this from happening again since {$200.00} was paid as promised by then. Days after I removed my bank information, another {$100.00} payment was processed on XX/XX/18 by Synchrony. As soon as I caught this on XX/XX/18, I called Synchrony to file a complaint and have the payment credited back to me as financially this put my checking account in the red. I told them I never authorized for them to automatically take money out of my account for payments and that I agreed to make the two {$100.00} payments myself online. I was transferred over to a supervisor, but the issue was not resolved at that moment as the blame seemed to be put on me by her, and that if I verified my account information including my checking account information, that I was authorizing them to automatically process payments to my Synchrony account. I was also told that my complaint would take 30 days to investigate before I would be considered for a refund. I asked how could they legally still process a payment if I had removed my checking account information from my profile, but no clear answer was given except that I had verified my checking account information and thus permitting money to be withdrawn by Synchrony. 

Weeks later, I called back Synchrony and told them to stop my claim as that third payment would cover me for XXXX payment, even though I did not approve for them to automatically take it from my checking account. This call was to an offshore call center, and agent assumed if you are not working you can collect unemployment. And of course, they asked for more payment. Also did not receive anything in writing from Synchrony in regard to these payments nor any emails.

So basically at this point, I am apprehensive to make payment to Synchrony because of this that occurred. I would think what they did was wrong on their part. Please investigate the practices of Synchrony CareCredit, so this does not happen again. And if I was wrong, then I understand but I know from my perspective what my intentions were.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,OH,,,Consent provided,Web,02/26/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3162871

02/26/2019,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"I graduated college back in XXXX. Back then, my school loan was with NY Department of Education and afterwards Sallie Mae. I was told numerous times that my starting salary in my field would be around $ 50k. With some smart saving I thought I would be able to still pay off my loan while my wife and I lived in a small 1 bedroom apartment. When I was finally offered a permanent job, it was at $ XXXX/hr in my field. A far cry from the $ XXXX that my college said I would start at. I called Sallie Mae and was never offered the income based payback method. Everything was with them was always deferment. This went on for years even after Navient took over. I went from under a $ 30k student loan to $ XXXX student loan because of all the deferments and the high interest rate of 8.125 %. The difference is all capitalized interest and whatever other fees they tacked on through the years. Navient wouldn't let me refinance at a lower rate because they said I was ineligible. They knew what they were doing and never told me I could of paid based on my tiny take home paycheck starting back in XXXX! Fast forward to XXXX. Im finally making a little money hoping to start making payments to bring this ridiculous monster debt that I shouldnt have down. Now all of a sudden they want to do income driven repayment. I told them I cant do more than $ 150/month. Everything they calculated was through my tax returns. Nobody from Navient would work with me regarding what I could actually afford to pay. Jump to XXXX and now Navient wants $ XXXX/month which I definitely cant do. The company seems to forget that I dont get to keep what the IRS reports and that Navient is not my only bill. I have to pay for my vehicles to get me to work to earn my paycheck. Pay for gas to get me back and forth to work as well as insurance. Pay for the roof over my head because in my job, I need to be awake and very alert. Pay for the various personal insurances. Monthly utility bills because heat would be nice in the cold months and a little a/c in the summer since where I live it gets very hot. The credit cards because thats the only way we can afford to buy our food and those are maxed out. My wife packs everything up for me and I dont order out because we cant afford it. Then there are other bills as well. You get my drift. I have told Navient time and time again, even paying $ XXXX/month is pushing it but I can do that on time every month unlike the {$720.00} payment. I want to pay it off, but I simply cant afford that much even though my tax returns look like I can. By the time everything is paid, Im lucky if we have {$5.00} left in the bank.

Its come to my attention that this debt was XXXX in my Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy back in early XX/XX/XXXX. And that is public information through XXXX.

In XXXX of XXXX I even had one representative from their customer relations department, via a phone call, say to me she didnt care about the bankruptcy that all she cared about was collecting money from me for this debt. On XX/XX/XXXX they openly admitted to you CFPB that the XXXX statements that they are in possession of are dated XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX, which shows they were aware this debt was XXXX in my XX/XX/XXXX bankruptcy. 
And in addition to all of that they are currently paying to report negative derogatory information on all 3 of my major credit bureau files. Which is in violation of the FCRA which states that while an item is being investigated the debt collector MUST indicate that the account is under dispute and must remove/cease from reporting any information on the item.

Obviously money paid out for law suites against them does nothing to make them change their practices so to be within the law. 
I sincerely appreciate the helping with the matter. But ultimately what really needs to take place is someone / some agency looking into all the complaints and lawsuits against them as a whole big picture of the company and stopping them from continually being able to break the law and hurt many consumers.

02/26/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I got a letter in the mail ( see attached ) saying my mortgage payments were going up but the letter didn't offer any clear reason why. The numbers they presented actually indicate that I would have overpaid, e.g. the "" what we estimated to pay out '' amount is actually lower than "" what we paid out. '' There are asterisks in Part 2 that don't match the description of what it should indicate - e.g. it says it indicates a discrepancy between an estimated amount and an actual amount but no such discrepancy exists. Additionally, there are numbers for county tax and property tax payments that don't match their estimates - either the estimate is XXXX or the payment is XXXX. This results in a statement printout that doesn't even attempt to explain why I'm expected to start paying more money. 

After a quick review of customer feedback online it's clear that Freedom Mortgage is very, very unpopular with its customers. I am truly worried that the company is trying to skim money from me, especially considering they designed, printed, and released a statement that doesn't offer proper justification and appears to be intentionally confusing. I tried to call their customer service number and after trying to navigate a phone system that is not user-friendly and provides endless menus with no ability to navigate, I tried pressing "" XXXX '' and was told I would by on hold for 56 minutes to speak to a representative. The combination of a very poorly designed statement asking me to pay extra without proper justification, terrible user reviews, and a phone system that appears intentionally designed to frustrate and deter customers leads me to suspect that something is amiss at Freedom Mortgage and I'd like you to investigate. 

Mortgage loan buyers are unique in my experience that I have to interact with them despite having no freedom of choice or transparency in the process by which Freedom Mortgage acquired my loan. A review of customer experiences online indicates that a terrible customer experience is the norm and no reasonable person would choose to do business with Freedom Mortgage intentionally. But because they bought my loan and there was nothing I could do to stop that, I am forced into doing business with a deceptive company. I've had good experiences with CFPB in the past in getting student loan payments counted when XXXX was fraudulently trying to deter me from doing so.

My credit card with Wells Fargo was hacked and {$7000.00} of fraudulent charges were made on it starting in XXXX of 2018. The established pattern of banking consisted of 2-3 transactions per month, simply transferring funds from the credit card to my checking account in large dollar amounts ; typically {$2000.00} to {$3000.00} at a time ; as I managed cash flow. This pattern was in process for approximately 12 months. When the account was hacked, there were suddenly dozens of transactions per day in small dollar amounts made to XXXX and XXXX accounts. 

Wells Fargo failed to notice the unusual account activity and when I discovered the problem and brought it to the attention of their fraud department, they took no responsibility for the problem and refused to reimburse me for the stolen funds. They stated in a letter that since I had paid my bill, that I automatically accept all charges made on the account. This is unacceptable negligence and the poorest customer care I can imagine.

02/26/2019,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with fees charged,"My car loan is through Santander Consumer USA and was legitimately repossessed in XXXX of XXXX due to me having fallen 3 months behind on my payments. When I called ( after the repossession ) to verify the necessary reinstallment amount to reclaim my vehicle and bring my account current, I was informed that the amount necessary to reinstate was {$1200.00}, but when I requested email or mail documentation from Santander to review the explanation of specific fees and charges that brought my balance to XXXX, I was informed by the customer service agent that Santander would not and had no obligation to provide such documentation in the case of repossession. I did not question the denial of my request any further, but do take issue with this business practice and would like to find out if, in fact, a lending institution is lawfully allowed to refuse such a request. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I made payment by phone of {$1200.00} ( which included my XX/XX/XXXX monthly payment of {$240.00} ) to reinstate my loan and bring my account completely current and to a {$0.00} balance. 
When I went to view my account on XX/XX/XXXX, I was shocked to view that even though I hadn't yet made my XX/XX/XXXX payment, my stated balance was {$940.00}. When I clicked on "" statement history '' on my account page, there was absolutely no explanation of what the additional {$700.00} was that I was being billed for. I called Santander immediately to resolve the issue and connected to a customer service representative who could not in any way give me a satisfactory reason for the {$700.00} charge. Her only explanation when I presented the fact that the {$1200.00} consisted of the three missed car payments totalling {$730.00} and the additional 3 months of late fees of {$12.00}, totalling {$770.00}, which left a remainder of {$430.00} charged to me for repossession fees, storage, transportation and auction fees, all having been paid on XXXX XXXX, and brought my account current, she put me on hold for almost 15 minutes with no explanation. I then demanded to speak to her supervisor and put on hold for another 9 minutes until a customer service supervisor, named XXXX came on the line, and I had to detail the issue all over again. XXXX and I reviewed the account with what minimal information was available to him, and he agreed that the balance due was inaccurate and there were duplicate charges assessed to me. He could also not inform me as to the specific breakdown of the charges and fees showing currently or the charges and fees that the {$1200.00} comprised of. As a result, he told me the only recourse was for him to submit a request ( confirmation # XXXX ) for further details and account balance correction to another department and I would be contacted no later than by Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX with a resolution to the issue. 
I emailed and called Santander several times after no one contacted me by the promised date, with no response whatsoever and was told no information was available to the customer service representatives I spoke to as well. 
When I called back this morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I was connected to an extremely hostile agent who could not intelligibly communicate or tell me what the result of the account review that XXXX had requested 10 days previous was. She persistently interrupted and talked over me, so that after 38 minutes on the phone with her, in frustration, I decided to disconnect and call back in chances that I would speak with a better informed and gracious representative. When I called back, I was put in touch with an agent named XXXX. Once again, I had to detail the billing issue and my dispute. After reviewing my account at length, XXXX concurred that the account balance was erroneous by his calculations and information accessible to him. He assured me that he would forward an additional request for account correction ( confirmation # XXXX ), and the issue will be resolved in 48 hours, which based on previous personal experience, is unlikely. 
If left unquestioned, a total of {$1100.00} will have been added to my account for miscellaneous items by Santander Consumer USA.

02/26/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Getting a credit card,Card opened as result of identity theft or fraud,"Synchrony Bank agreed to delete a hard inquiry on my credit report for a Wal-Mart card.

Instead they are forcing me to have a hard inquiry for a card we dont have or want and couldnt be processed.

They couldnt access my reports and did not get permission to access ( fraud alert placed on all agencies-actual identity theft issue ).

They did not send any documents for deletion, which they claimed could be sent by mail only, for the deletion or reduction of the inquiry to soft pull.

They argued that I had chosen to apply and couldnt back out because of their agreement.

Synchrony seems to try and bully people not interested in their store-only accounts into having accounts they dont want. My credit file had a fraud alert and both XXXX and XXXX were locked and frozen when these occurred, I had unlocked XXXX to do prequalified card offers only. 

They had three applications and said they would not process them, but I received emails saying they had processed the applications, and claiming they were unable verify my identity over the phone.

I had actually verified to them at least five times giving them all the info for their records in order to be allowed to discuss the accounts with them, but it was as though they were creating an application while I was protesting, telling me I wanted the card and couldnt stop them from processing.

I explained to Synchrony that I had visited several of their sites in the past but hadnt applied. I told her I had visited WalMart site but only saw partial details comparing two cards. Synchrony argued I had provided them my full SSN and identity info ( which now they claim they dont have ), but they only had the info because they forced me to give all the info to them the first time I called, and every call after. WalMart isnt allowed to build stores in XXXX XXXX, so its obviously unusual pressure to apply for the card even after they ignored my fraud alert. 

I need the inquiry to be deleted. The application was never processed and no one contacted me for authorization prior to access any credit reports under the fraud alert.

02/26/2019,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Upon reading XXXX XXXX resignation letter last XX/XX/XXXX ( the former student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ), I felt compelled to file a protest, detailing the financial and emotional abuse Ive endured since I decided to enroll in the Department of Educations Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

Even if this is nothing more than an exercise in futility or a whimper in the wilderness, I feel it would be a dereliction of my duty as both a consumer and a citizen if I didnt lodge an official complaint, to go on the record, because I have been harmed personally by the odious and improper student loan practices of the aforementioned PSLF program. Even more, to compound this grievance, I feel Ive been abandoned by the very same Bureau ( the CFPB ) that was created to serve as my advocate, and tasked by Congress to protect me from such blatant exploitation! 

After experiencing the aggravation firsthand, over the course of a few years ; after having to deal with the mandates of Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and, particularly, how this is interpreted by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( a contracted company the Department of Education has asked to handle the administration and customer service for its PSLF program ), I felt I could sit idly and silently no longer. 

The abbreviated version of events : I was recruited to work for a rural XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, XXXX  ). Part of the recruiting pitch ( and part of the allure ) was that my student debt would be forgiven after ten years of service, if I came to work for them, being that they are a qualified county facility. In other words, if I came to work for them and continued to make my loan payments, whatever balance remained, so I was told, after ten years of service, then that remaining balance would be forgiven. What a recruiting pitch! This sounded great. I did some research into the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and sure enough if I worked for a public service-eligible XXXX  ( which this was ) then my debt would be forgiven after 120 payments. So, with this lucrative perk in mind, I accepted the position to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I decided to relocate, dragging my family 1,800 miles across the country, moving from XXXX XXXX to the XXXX XXXX. 

I moved in XX/XX/XXXX, and started working the following month. It took from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to be placed into an eligible PSLF repayment program ( 12 months! ). Thats a whole year ; ten percent of the time I was supposed to be working in a qualified environment. For some reason, my spouses employment status prevented me from being put into an eligible program. Why would my husbands employment status be a deciding factor, delaying my enrollment? The program clearly states that I only need to be working at a qualified facility for a requisite length of time ( and be enrolled in a qualified repayment plan ). My husband was out of work when we applied, and this fact somehow disqualified me from consideration! Why? This was the first major red flag that something was amiss, and rotten in the state of XXXX. 

Again, I was hired by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX ), to be their full-time XXXX XXXX, working 40 hours a week. I took this position based in part by the false promise of the PSLF program, believing that my student debt would be forgiven after ten years of service/payments I was working at a public service XXXX when I applied for PSLF ; my employer certified the necessary documents immediately. Still, I was denied because I was told they couldnt certify my husbands employer. I told them he was unemployed and nothing but crickets and denials. An entire year went by until I was placed in a PSLF qualified repayment plan. 

And, how did I finally get accepted? Lo and behold, when my husband was hired to work in XXXX, XXXX, at the end of XX/XX/XXXX then, suddenly, I was approved and enrolled into an eligible PSLF repayment program. HOWEVER, at this time, somehow the proverbial they decided to recalculate how much I would owe on a monthly basis. Based on some unknown algorithm, a figure that determines my households ability to repay, my monthly payments ballooned from {$340.00} a month to {$560.00}. This doesnt sound like a loan forgiveness plan It sounds like, OK let us re-amortize your loan, figure out what amount you need to pay to pay-off the loan in 120 payments, with the service provider grabbing their 33 % markup in profits ( off the interest ). This is a total bait and switch. Its actually mocking me when the PSLF uses the word forgiveness because there isnt a penny thats being forgiven. I am paying off the loan, in its entirety. 

The parameters are clear : Public Service Loan Forgiveness is a federal program that ( supposedly ) forgives federal student loans for borrowers who are employed full-time ( 30+ hours a week ) in an eligible federal, state, or local public service job. Where in this does it stipulate that your spouse must be working? Where does it state that the program will review your households annual income and then determine how much you owe, per month, based on your households financial vitality? Why does this matter? Why should it? The program was established to help certain facilities and regions attract talented candidates this is the spirit that led to the creation of the program. Its supposed to be an added benefit, not an aggravation! 

HOW IS IT THAT THIS IS CONSIDERED LOAN FORGIVENESS? 

In other words, heres what the actions of PSLF are stating loudly to me : Go work in public service and qualify for loan forgiveness and then pay nearly seventy thousand dollars on a XXXX XXXX   dollar balance. And, to mock you, we will call this a loan forgiveness. This isnt forgiveness, this is merely paying off a loan in ten years!

This is blatant bait-and-switch. This is fine print nonsense. There is no loan forgiveness being offered here. This is simply taking a 20-year loan repayment plan and changing it to a 10-year loan payment plan. I never would have moved halfway across the country, moved to a rural community, if I knew this was what the PSLF offered. This spits in the face of the idea of loan forgiveness and betrays the intent behind the creation of such a program to begin with. Again, I ask : how is this a reward for public service?

For a more detailed explanation of my plight, allow me to expound on the particulars : My name is XXXX XXXX. I graduated, with degree, from the XXXX  XXXX University XXXX program ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in XX/XX/XXXX. During my schooling, I amassed approximately {$46000.00} in student loan debt. ( This was a wise investment in my future, on my part, because XXXX   is a fruitful career path with lots of job openings and opportunities ; According to a XXXX report from XXXX, the median annual income for an XXXX was nearly {$82000.00} ). 

Immediately after graduation, in XX/XX/XXXX, I began working as an XXXX for a XXXX, XXXX  based XXXX -- XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. Then, six months later, I began to make my student debt payments, promptly, after my initial grace period expired. 

Initially, I enrolled in the 20-year plan. I did this to keep my payments as low as possible ( even though this repayment plan incurred the biggest interest cost ). I was fine with this, and with paying the enormous interest, because I knowingly entered into this obligation understanding the liability I was taking on. Like I wrote earlier, this was an investment in my future and it was worth it. Sure, I was perplexed to understand a system where the government would loan money to banks at zero percent interest rate, then those banks turn around and lend that money out at interest to students ( to encourage banks to lend money to students for education ). I mean, shouldnt the government simply loan money directly to students, so the government could earn the usury profits, and so students would receive the lowest interest rate possible )? Doesnt that make more sense, for a government of, by, and for the taxpaying people. 

From XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, over the first 53 months paying back my student loans, I made every monthly payment. My payments were in the {$340.00} range. I paid approximately {$18000.00} over the course of these fifty-three payments ( of which only {$4200.00} went towards principal, and {$14000.00} going towards the interest ). 

I moved to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I began working at my new position that XXXX. From XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, for almost 6 months, I was attempting in vain to enroll in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Even though I was eligible, and shouldve qualified without incident, I was denied about three times because there was an apparent issue with my husbands work. When we moved, my husband was no longer employed. He was working full-time in XXXX, at a XXXX XXXX, but when we moved to XXXX  he didnt have employment ( other than XXXX  XXXX work he did, for about 6K a year ). He wrote a letter and said as much, but we still couldnt qualify The PSLF program wouldnt approve my application because of some hiccup with my husband, which to this day I have no idea what the issue was. I was told they couldnt verify employment, even though I constantly told them that my husband wasnt employed ( at the time of my application ). 

Anyway, in XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were consolidated from XXXX to XXXX XXXX. Against my wishes, I was enrolled in a program that didnt qualify for the PSLF. My payment was about {$320.00}. I called for the umpteenth time Anyway, that XX/XX/XXXX my husband was hired by XXXX XXXX XXXX. And, would you believe, this was when the PSLF program finally approved my application. Now that my husband was working, for some particularly strange reason, the program accepted my application! Why would my husbands employment status determine my eligibility? 
So, after certifying my employment at XXXX XXXX XXXX, and calibrating what the PSLF deemed I was mandated to pay monthly, I was finally enrolled into the PSLF program in XX/XX/XXXX ( one year after I began the enrollment process ). And, guess what my payments were tallied at {$560.00} dollars a month! What a joke. How is it that this is considered loan forgiveness?

In essence, 120 payments of {$560.00} comes to about {$67000.00}. When I consolidated my loans into this PSLF program, I owed {$46000.00}. This was more than my original loan amount ( because after 4.5 years of payments, most of my payments when towards paying the interest down ). So, when I accepted the job at a rural XXXX, and got excited when I heard about the PSLF perk, little did I know that loan forgiveness meant paying {$67000.00} over 120 payments to pay off the existing {$46000.00} balance.

Changing the loan from a 20-year payment plan to a 10-year payment plan is not loan forgiveness. At the end of my 120 PSLF payments, altogether, going back to when I first began paying off my debt, I wouldve ended up paying {$85000.00} total in payments, from the time I made my first payment in XX/XX/XXXX. Nearly {$86000.00} dollars on a {$46000.00} loan! 

But, the part that aggravates me most, is the misleading fact that I enrolled in the PSLF program, owing just {$46000.00}, and the PSLF program upped my payments from {$340.00} to {$560.00}. In essence, the program demands that I pay about {$67000.00} over ten years, and has the gall to deem this loan forgiveness. 

In conclusion, contending with the deceitful fine-print and the legalistic tentacles of the program has weakened my faith and trust in the Department of Education in general ( and the student loan industry specifically ). The financial turmoil spawned by the false promise of the PSLF program has directly impacted my familys standard of living, while, on a more personal level, the emotional distress caused by the misleading PSLF propaganda has wreaked havoc on my gastrointestinal tract. Just the mere thought of the programs criminal bait- & -switch violations, no matter when the thought surfaces, irritates me beyond repair. What does this say about the student loan industry? When a GAO report discovers that 99 % of applications have been denied ( 29,000 applications denied! ), I worry about what will happen when I make my 120th payment. Im upset now, after only 30 payments ( only 1/4th of the way thru ) I dont trust the PSLF program, and Im already bracing myself for more trouble when I make my final ( 120th ) payment. I dont trust that the Department of Education will honor their pledge. To be frank, I have zero faith that the PSLF will live up to its obligation. If it took over a year to qualify and enroll in the PSLF repayment service, I fear what awaits for me down the line.",,AES/PHEAA,OR,,,Consent provided,Web,02/26/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3162910

Fast forward 3 months and my credit score drops close to 100 point due to Conns reporting as late.

I haven't made any repayments since XX/XX/XXXX ( ie, for more than eight years now ) because the next suggested repayment date after my last repayment in XX/XX/XXXX was  XX/XX/XXXX and I was under the impression that interest would not accrue on the remaining principal of about {$16000.00} while I am not making repayments. The online statements available on Wells Fargo website also did not show any accrued interest, which confirmed my view. However, when I recently dug into my loan details, I figured out that interest had been accruing and amounts to a whopping {$5700.00}.

Phone recordings from Navient, selectively produced by Navient, seem to indicate that I was told my loans don't qualify.

The person on the phone confirmed that they would use my given method of contact to communicate with me in the future. 

During the prohibited office call today, I asked the rep immediately if there were any notes from my XX/XX/XXXX discussion with them. They noted everything that was discussed on XX/XX/XXXX except for me telling them not to call me at work. This is utterly ridiculous. I would've hoped that after explaining to the Navient reps that calling me at work is strictly prohibited that they would stop. This has not been the case.

02/26/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"In XX/XX/2018 I received a shipment of something I did not order. I immediately contacted Chase Visa credit card and they confirmed fraudulent activity on my account. They closed and re-issued my card. 

I checked my account online and noted 2 fraudulent purchases : 1 ) One item shipped to my home from XXXX for {$440.00} ( dated  XX/XX/XXXX ) and another from XXXX XXXX ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) for {$830.00}. The latter was shipped somewhere else. I made one attempt to call XXXX to request a return label. There was no answer, and I sensed it was a "" shady '' company so I did not pursue further. Instead I requested that Chase follow-up with them for return instructions. Although both charges were initially cancelled, Chase later reinstated the XXXX charge claiming that I had "" benefited '' from this purchase. ( it is a large kitty litter box which was of zero value to me. ) My complaint is against Chase, in particular their "" recovery/fraud '' team. They are based in the XXXX and I have noticed a disturbing pattern during my conversations with them. They made the following false statements to me : 1 ) The XXXX purchase was a "" chip '' transaction. 
( This is impossible as it is an online only company. This was easily confirmed by checking their website. Why didn't Chase check also? ) Here is a link, please scroll down to bottom XXXX XXXX XXXX 2 ) XXXX had my email address therefore I must have made the purchase. 
( The address they told me was a XXXX account which I have never had. ) 3 ) They said I needed to send Chase proof that I did not order this. ( I'm not sure how to prove that I did NOT do something. When I asked what they meant by proof they suggested I send a copy of a police report. I did not file a police report nor do I believe it is the job of my local/state police to handle Chase 's online fraud! ) 4 ) They claimed that I had approved the XXXX XXXX purchase when they knew full well that I did not. I suggested they look into the shipment address for the XXXX charge for clues as to who had my credit card number. They said they would have to charge this BACK to my credit card in order to re-open an inquiry. Why was this not part of the initial inquiry? It seems highly likely to me that the two charges were made by the same person and they could find the other shipment address helpful. 

5 ) Finally, after talking to a Chase Fraud supervisor, she scheduled a conference call for today between her ( XXXX ) and XXXX in which I would participate. I called today to make sure this was happening and was told that the records showed I had declined to be on the call. This is totally false! They eventually admitted to me that they had made a mistake in saying that I refused to be on the call. 

I fully intend to close any accounts I have with Chase after this experience. In the meantime I would greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide.

XXXX XXXX contracted a company to due collections and other dealings pertaining to Mortgages. This companies name is XXXX. I was having a hardship back in XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted XXXX to explain my situation. XXXX at the time explained my options. One of the options was to do a forbearance. I agreed that this would be the best solution to my hardship. They said they would send out the paperwork, that I needed to fill out and return by the end of XXXX. I agreed to the terms and to the contract. After I sent it in, they sent back the approval, and the Forbearance  would start on XX/XX/XXXXand end at the end of XXXX, and at that time I could decide to do a modification or refinance my loan. my payment would be for the amount of XXXX at the first of every month until XXXX. I called in the first payment and it was a check for the amount of XXXX. It was written from my church. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and banked through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was abler to get a confirmation that it was accepted. I then sent my second payment for the amount of XXXX. No problems. It wasn't until the end of XXXX that I received letter stating my forbearance  was terminated due to a routing number. They stated that they must receive a letter from the bank confirming that the routing number had not changed. I called immediately to see what they were talking about. They could not give me any information except to dispute it and reapply for another forbearance. I sent a dispute a couple days latter to the fax number they given me to send my dispute. A couple weeks later I received the papers to do another forbearance. I then called weekly to follow up. I called weekly from XXXX to XXXX. I would call and they would tell me everything looks great XXXX XXXX not to worry that it is in the process and to call again in another week to follow up or find out the results. After numerous calls and frustration, I was able to get a answer, after demanding and waiting on the phone over 2 hours, the young lady came on and said sorry. She said she was sorry for both the forbearance and my dispute being turned down. I asked why and she couldn't give me a answer. In the dispute I sent a letter from the bank, a copy of the check, and all the other information to show that the routing number was good no changes and the check was good. XXXX never tried to put the check through, this is from the bank that covered the check XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX cancelled my forbearance without calling or notifying me, until almost 3 months later. I didn't have any idea that my forbearance  was cancelled until months later, or that XXXX never tried to put the check through the bank. I was devastated and continued to do everything I could to work with XXXX and to show them this was not any of my fault. I spent 3 months waiting and calling continually every week to solve and get answers to this dilemma. All this time they were telling me not to worry, that it seemed to them it would go through. I even ask for supervisors and Managers to help or get involved. I only received from the customer service that a supervisor would go through all the calls and recordings and get back with me. I received nothing. In XXXX after I was told that the forbearance and the dispute was turned down, that if I couldn't come up with the arrearages that foreclosure would start. I was beside myself. My new wife couldn't handle it and we separated. we had to tell our children, they were devastated. I received a letter from XXXX, stating that they have sent it to a foreclosure  attorney and I needed to contact them. The XXXX week of XXXX I receive another letter stating that XXXX is longer involved. That they sold or sent my loan to a new company called XXXX. It stated that the loan will be with XXXX starting XXXX and that I would need t contact them and not XXXX. I've contacted XXXX, I even did a modification. when I spoke to XXXX told them what has been going on, they stated that it did not matter, because I was now with them. I asked them about my modification and they stated it probably wont go through and I should try and sell as soon as I can. They also told me that I need to contact the attorneys involved. I ask the name and phone and it was the same foreclosure attorney as XXXX. There shouldn't be any reason why this is happening. If XXXX would of deposited the check, my forbearance would of never been cancelled. It doesn't make any sense why they didn't even try. and after knowing that there wasn't any problems they didn't do anything to help. and they got gave my loan to another company without resolving any of the issues. XXXX also wasted 3 to 4 months getting back with me or answering anything to do with the forbearance or dispute. They added late fees and added appraisal fees, added for a person to come to the home continuously to see if it was occupied by us, and I'm not sure but I also think that they charged to to the forbearance or redo the loan. They told me to hold off in making any payments until the issues were resolved. I don't understand why they keep me going on for months.why did it take months. why couldn't anyone give me any answer until months later. My family and I are devastated and don't understand why they would do this. Please investigate or help us in this serious matter.

Dear whomever this may concern, My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. I currently have an open debt with XXXX XXXX Hospital of  {$2500.00}. They have passed on this debt to your collection agency. I have tried to reach out to your establishment on multiple occasions and have not gotten the answers or assistance I needed. 

I first contacted your company three weeks ago on XX/XX/XXXX. On this day I spoke to a man about settling my debt at {$1800.00}. He told me he needed to confirm with the hospital and for me to contact him again the following week. I then tried to contact him again, and no one answered my call. A week ago I called to follow up again and the people I spoke with told me absolutely nothing about settling this debt. They told me they had not heard back from the hospital. I find it very hard to believe that the hospital has not gotten back to them in three weeks. I even offered two staff members to pay {$1000.00} and be done with this. One staff member even laughed at the situation when I was trying to express my concerns. 

I demand to have my questions addressed and have this resolved. I am on the west coast so taking time out of my day to call your company that only has EST hours is very difficult. 

I would AGAIN like to settle this debt immediately and can pay {$1000.00} at your earliest convenience. I can be contacted via phone at XXXX between XXXX EST. Please have a MANAGER contact me tomorrow XX/XX/2019. This is my fourth attempt at trying to pay this debt.

I asked to speak to a manager to file a formal complaint based on the fact that I applied for credit regardless I was a cosigner or primary that I completed a credit application and provided any requested supporting documents which included a hard credit pull that I was not formally notified of a decision simply that they could just withdraw my request for credit. My complaint I believe includes several of illegal business practices. I believe if I did not qualify under SOFI 's standards then the application should have been declined, I should have received a formal notification in writing which would allow me to follow up as a consumer. I do not understand how a company can legally pull my credit and then simply Withdraw my application and not provide information to the consumer. I do not understand how the other party involved my daughter the primary applicant received an email that I as the cosigner was ineligible, when I myself as the applicant did not receive proper notice. I believe legally when a consumer applies for credit via a credit application provides all necessary documentation to complete the application the application needs to either be declined or approved and the consumer needs to be formally notified. I do not see how SOFI can legally pull a hard credit pull find a reason not to qualify my request and simply WITHDRAW my application.

The transaction was declined, So, I called the Customer services of the PNC Bank to Authorize the transaction, after verifying my self and while I was on the phone with the bank 's agent she asked me to try process the payment again and it was also declined, then they transferred me to the supervisor to remove the fraud alert on the car, and I was on phone with him made the purchase it was finally successful and Airline issued me the PNR Reference and Ticket and I have received an E-mail from the bank with the transaction details. 

On the Morning of XX/XX/2019 at XXXX ; XXXX XXXX was my flight, I went to the Airport and found that my ticket was revoked and canceled without any Notice either from the bank or the Airline, and After Inquiry, they stated that the bank did instruct the Airline of revoking this transaction due to fraud alert. 

I called the PNN bank and filed a complaint under the number : XXXX the same day. 
Bank have replied that they had to take this action despite the fact that I took the required actions by verifying and cleaning the Transaction. Bank has refused to provide the proper remedy or a resolution to my complaint and compensate me for the losses I sustained due to their revoking the transaction and my trip although, I have followed the proper procedures in such fraud alert at case by calling the bank and with their guidance and instructions I was able to buy the Airline Ticket. 

I have been damaged by the Bank wrong actions, despite I had complied with all the proper procedures to validate the transaction. 

1- The reasoning that I should have called them to remove the alert and clear and approve the transaction which I did. It is provided by the following evidence : 1- The Transaction made and a bank receipt was received for the transaction. 
2- a Phone call made prior to the bank to validate the transaction to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX lasted for XXXX Minutes and XXXX seconds. ( this is where I was on the phone with bank verifying and acknowledging the transaction, which resulted and end of buying the Airline Ticket and transaction was successfully made ). 
3- The Whole Transaction was made by my Credit Card where is My Name is there and the Name of the Passenger is The Same as the Name of the Credit Card Charged. So, How this Could be a Fraud? and The Airline Has these Data under the PNR reference. 

Finally, Today, I called the Escalated Department of the Bank where they refused to offer any equitable solution nor taking any account or responsibilities of their actions that cause my monetary loses as well as emotional stress. 
2- bank refused my request to speak with their XXXX to address my case and informed me that this is the hights it can get, No resolution and no further action can be made. 

Therefore, I'm filing this complaint with CFPB against the PNC Bank, asking for a proper monetary remedy under the law and as per the consumer protection law and any other applicable USA laws.

02/26/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"On the evening of XX/XX/XXXX I made arrangements with the so called Sr. loan officer at Fortren Funding located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ XXXX to refinance my mortgage and ever since then I have been complaining because they think their swift in covering up costly numbers for their clients and am fully on to their scheme in robbing innocent families with outstanding credit, then destroy them with phony personnel. It started when XXXX XXXX told me to stop making payments to my current lender at ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX at this point XXXX XXXX  stated to me to let my new LENDER know that they will not pay my taxes for the 1st quarter. I let XXXX know about this and at first it was OK. and after mid month I received a late payment from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I then contacted XXXX and XXXX XXXX another sales manager who went over my documentation to clarify my credit history and sign docs to qualify for the loan and had an XXXX credit score.So I cancelled ... This is when XXXX contacted me and said "" no '' don't cancel because it was only a matter of my tax payment that the title company refused to pay up front for me to start my escrow account. However, we can start the process again the following month because there is still time before my 1st quarter taxes were due and I will submit the same contract again with no closing cost to you and don't worry about the late fee because you are still saving 2 hundred a month to keep your 2nd home. I said "" please put this in writing and e-mail me that info ... and he did so ''. XXXX then instructed a Title company named XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time located in XXXX nj to arrange documentation on what we discussed And when XXXX XXXX arrived to my home on the evening mentioned XX/XX/XXXX she arrived with the HUD and we signed documents together as well as an unpaid hospice bill that appeared under my Dad 's name before he passed away in XXXX and simply had this removed from damaging my credit by notarizing that I was solely XXXX XXXX XXXX not XXXX ... And discussed like XXXX had mentioned to me that "" although he said, "" that there is no additional closing cost..there will be 500.00 from out of pocket expenses for the title agent and other fee if I can come up with XXXX with a cashier 's check to meet the tax deadline, since I will be skipping 2 monthly payments and receiving a disbursement check "" from my old lender ( XXXX XXXX ) for the amount of 1900 and change but not until LATER in XXXX since my old escrow account is being washed. and there we go XXXX stated, I also asked XXXX about the XXXX being the tax deadline and questioned how taxes were being paid and XXXX stated, they had to be escrowed into mortgage account from title company for recording and mentioned that it's a refinance and a few days late will not effect anything maybe a few extra dollars. He also told me to remember that we were brother 's being that were both from the same town 1 mile apart. At this time XXXX told both myself and my girlfriend that this cashier 's check is strictly for my tax payment and nothing else and attached it with the 1st payment letter on the HUD and mentioned again "" for taxes only! '' as she held it up to us. And this is where it does get tricky because the actual contract on the HUD realize is the original contract from when XXXX then XXXX stepped in as the Sr. loan officer to service the majority of this loan, XXXX or known as XXXX started the contract to approve my loan. So being numbers were left the same from the previous month evidently there has been a history of confusion and me and my family had to sacrifice over what XXXX had mentioned was a HUGE mistake and would have this problem handled ASAP for me when I contacted him by XX/XX/XXXX and asked him why only partial payment was made towards my taxes? I contacted him a few weeks later and told him that my taxes were still due but not delinquent and will have to pay on my own since I had a ton of money at that time. XXXX and my township asked why should I if I already escrowed them? And my town stated that they will put a yellow sticker on? XXXX said he checked again and they would be paying them soon. By the following year of XX/XX/XXXX I was receiving odd e-mails about unauthorized payments from my checking account for late payments from XXXX XXXX located over seas where all negative information was recorded to my credit history as well as the unpaid lien that was from my father 's and had to pay numerous penalties and fees for this error. By XX/XX/XXXX my car payment drastically increased along with my mortgage payment costing me an extra cost of living of 300.00 per month with an escrow shortage and canceled credit card. When I contacted XXXX he asked me who paid my taxes? I told him XXXX and he did not say anything but he will get back. I called again and this is when he disconnected his phone. I finally called in XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to anther man XXXX XXXX who I never met and would not know what XXXX and I actually arranged. So he stated that he was taking charge of this loan and took a look at it and asked if this was a no appraisal fee and skipping 2 payments I said yes. he then asked me if I received a disbursement check? I said yes, then XXXX asked what did I do with it? spend it! I said yes towards my 1st 2 voucher payments made to fortren funding in the amount of XXXX when my payments were less than that amount and ended up with an escrow shortage after the 1st analysis came due from the negligence from the originators from what I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX and went directly to a credit service then sold to them delinquent after contacting their ombudsman dept. XXXX then told me it was too late to make any changes and not to have no more contact with them because no one is here to help me except my current lender who ever they were because my loan got all screwed up. By the time it was then sold to XXXX XXXX   my current lender I was and have been facing more escrow shortages, late payments diminished credit score and had to sell my second home and became XXXX because I thought this was a temporary mishap. And having no choice than to pay the losses to avoid losing my primary residence. By the summer of XXXX I was facing XXXX losses and submitting many complaints but the damages at that time were not severe enough for me to pursue and I received a phone call from a third party at Fortren Funding XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX and he told me that XXXX is no longer available to explain how this loan fell out of my favor and would be too costly in court with all of the banks handling my loan and suggested that I request a loan modification where that would reduce my interest another point and any liens that were recorded would be forgotten and that none of these consumer complaints believe me because the XXXX messed up the paperwork. I knew that this was another false misrepresentation so I reported all of this to my current lender. I also did contact other authorities. An experienced Sr.loan officer with my credit history and the HUD presented to them is self explanatory with the 48th month history if examining, the timing of the disbursement check which I was accused of spending towards my taxes ... HUD 1 settlement statement lines XXXX fees XXXX line XXXX taxes ( XXXX  ) XXXX XXXX with tax certificate showing that taxes were open for XX/XX/XXXX on the evening at closing. And the payoff to my former lender ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) At this time of course everyone involved has avoided any involvement in this criteria and are probably out there in other offices after closing down. Hopefully this will give a clearer picture how these people who can not maintain their own lives, careers and jobs, families etc.It 's the people who work hard like my father did and I who have outstanding credit and a work history of 39 straight years in the work force until I had to work harder at XXXX years old for what started as a simple mistake.

Hi, I need help urgently. 

Ive was with Sallie Mae prior to XXXX and Navient since about XXXX. 

Ive worked full-time for a non-profit since XX/XX/XXXX. 

Ive had major difficulties with Navient since my loans were switched to Navient in or around XXXX to XXXX. 

My question : Why did they not immediately advise me to switch to a direct loan and/or Public Service Loan Program back in XXXX? 

Although they have documented over 60 on-time IBR payments on time since XXXX I was originally setup prior for IBR prior to XXXX, however, Navient made several critical processing errors in subsequent years, I believe in order to revoke and extend my IBR plan beyond the 20 to 25 years as required in order to apply for forgiveness. 

Even after many phone calls explaining to them that I had submitted my IBR request in XXXX of the prior year, when renewal was scheduled for XXXX the following year, they not only did not process my paperwork on time, which caused in accurate bank transfer collection but also caused inaccurate reporting of on time payments. 

These one-time charged were in amounts of over {$500.00} and over {$1600.00}. They didnt even send me an email prior to sending the payment requests? 


Their incompetence and I believe fraudulent activity, not only caused me be farther behind payments on my IBR program, they also flat out lied to me when I asked them if there was another payment program relating to my employment with a non-profit 501 ( c ) 3. 

They said I did not qualify without even directing me to the proper federal government website in order to confirm what they were saying. They also didnt even consider asking me for my employers non-profit status and/or contact information to verify the status of my employment. 

Im under the assumption that there are recorded phone messages that will corroborate these statements as I had spent many hours on the phone with Navient arguing as to why my annual IBR applications were delayed by over 3-months on several different occasions/years. 

I really need advice on how to proceed and how to find a suitable way to correct these violations to my rights. 

Im also, is in the process of working with Docusign to apply for a Direct consolidation loan in order to qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program requiring 120 months of on time payments, however I dont know if hey will advise me on my rights to obtain retroactive IBR payment credits that can be applied to a Direct Public Serice Loan Forgiveness program, as Navient is an official government approved loan servicing provider. 

Navient has documented over 60 on-time payments, however I believe the number should have been much higher, closer to between 90 & 100 payments.

I informed XXXX that apparently my dept to income ratio is too high, as I was told by another refinance company, so I cant do it. He told me to send the documents about XXXX different income documents. He said that my debt to income was high, but If I could prove that I wasn't paying the mortgage for over a year he may can do it.

I spoke with him several times from then to XX/XX/XXXX. 
I then got a call from XXXX XXXX around XX/XX/XXXX, stating he works at Loan Depot, I asked him why he was calling because I had just spoke with XXXX and he said he works with XXXX and was furthering the loan ahead, he made it seem as if he was the next step. He sounded shady and predatory. I questioned him why he couldn't just get the information from XXXX that he was requesting and he said that he would and called me back, stating he would be able to do this at an even better rate and financial option. He stated that he got everything needed to proceed from XXXX. I informed his as well as XXXX, not to order an appraisal unless he knew that I could do this loan, he stated that he would not order it unless everything was okay. I asked him how much the house needed to appraise at in order to be okay, he said around XXXX. He asked for {$18.00} to lock in a rate and to ensure that I would be forwarding the process with him.

What this complaint is about is the fact that Navient was supposed to expunge my credit report, and they did not. This was their mistake, they acknowledged as much and returned the fees ( on paper ) they had charged me. And yet, I'm still paying for it. I can't call them, because I'm not a customer any longer.

Neither one of these non-payments generated any correspondence from TD Bank, giving us the impression all was good. During the same period, approx. early XX/XX/XXXX, TD Bank did send correspondence letting us know that the last payment would not be taken by auto pay due to their system and that we would need to make other arrangement, Check or over the phone payment, to make the final installment.

A week later, TD Bank sent two letters that arrived on the same day, one being the lien release, the other being a statement saying that they could report our delinquency to the reporting agencies, which they did. I have reached out to TD Bank multiple times since this incident and have been informed that because an auto pay was declined by my wife 's bank, their system is not "" set up '' to generate a non-payment letter because of "" insufficient funds '' reason.

Risky loan terms and structures : The practice of making credit card balances with terms or structures that make it more difficult or impossible for consumers to reduce their indebtedness. XXXX Cycle of Debt : XXXX used illegal debt collection tactics to create a false sense of urgency to lure overdue borrowers into debt traps. XXXX use Cavalry debt collector to claim {$10000.00} They would encourage overdue consumers to temporarily pay off their loans and then quickly re-borrow from them again.

I would pay new fees each time they took out another balance from them.

On XX/XX/2019, C & W violated 15 U.S.C. 1692 ( f ) ( 1 ), also known as 808 of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which states that "" [ a ] debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt ... the following conduct is a violation of this section : ( 1 ) The collection of any amount ( including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation ) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law. '' The circumstances of this violation are as follows : a ) on XX/XX/2019,  I, the reporter and consumer, called C & W to settle an account it had reported to the credit bureaus under my name, and which it claimed was an amount owed by me. The original creditor was XXXX XXXX, and the alleged original debt amount was {$490.00}. I offered to pay the account in full conditioned by the guarantee that C & W would delete the account permanently and completely from my credit reports. C & W agreed. I provided my credit card number to C & W. C & W, prior to charging my card for the amount allegedly owed, insisted to me that there was a "" {$12.00} convenience fee '' that I had to remit in order to make my payment. C & W claimed that I was required to pay {$500.00} to settle the account. C & W had previously refused to provide any verification or accounting of the amount I owed. C & W did not provide any evidence that state law permitted a {$12.00} "" convenience fee '' or that the original creditor 's agreement with me provided for a {$12.00} "" convenience fee ''. In fact, the original creditor 's claimed amount owing of {$490.00} already included a {$5.00} "" installment fee '', and the amount had long since been solidified by C & W and the original credit as the final amount due and owing - and this amount is the amount C & W reported to the credit bureaus.

C & W 's insistence that I pay an amount in excess of this amount is a clear and flagrant violation of the FDCPA, and I suspect that C & W is committing this violation with most, if not all, of its other accounts on which it is collecting from consumers. This deceptive and highly illegal practice must cease at once.

Finally, C & W refused to issue a receipt or confirmation of my payment to me in writing, whether electronically, via mail, or otherwise. C & W issued a "" payment confirmation number '' to me, which it asserted was : XXXX.

We had to escalate the file and reopen my case with Chase and push to get a new valuation. Chase finally consented and a value of $ XXXX came in. We asked to review it. It was bogus.

02/25/2019,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"To Whom It May Concern, On XX/XX/XXXX I accepted an offer from Wells Fargo to be put on their "" Disaster Aid Relief Plan '' due to the fact I had been impacted by the two Hurricanes late summer. This plan required no payments while under the plan and also offered "" credit bureau reporting protection '' suppressing all credit reporting while under the plan. The plan consisted of an automatic initial 90 day period at when concluded would then convert to a loan modification to extend the payments that had accrued unpaid during this time frame to the end of the loan. The modification plan consists of me making three monthly payments beginning in XXXX and ending in XXXX at which point the loan would be permanently "" modified '' putting the past due payments to the end of the loan. 
Since XXXX when I accepted Wells Fargo 's offer to be put on this "" disaster relief plan '', I have on six different occasions been assured by my disaster relief reprsentative "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' XXXX that absolutely under no circumstances would any negative credit bureau reporting would take place as I repeatedly advised her that my credit was paramount and I most certainly did not want to be reported negatively to the credit bureaus. In fact she advised me "" NOT '' to make any payments during this process and "" NOT '' to worry about them reporting me past due to the credit bureaus assuring me with statements of "" Wells Fargo has your back '', "" We are there for you during this trying time '' "" what has happened to you is not your fault and that is why we have this plan to help you '' etc. etc. 
Additionally, I attempted to reach her on two occasion 's the past few months and I was referred to her Manager "" XXXX XXXX '' ( XXXX ) XXXX the manager over the department as she was out of the office. During the first conversation with Mr. XXXX he again stated and gave me the exact same assurance as Ms. XXXX had and since I was under their "" disaster relief modification program '' and not under a "" regular modification program '' absolutely no negative credit reporting would take place. 
The second conversation I had with Mr. XXXX consisted of him informing me that my "" disaster relief modification '' was approved and that my credit was "" protected until XX/XX/XXXX '' to allow for completion of my disaster relief modification. '' Again stating how they were going "" above and beyond '' to assist their customer 's during this trying time to take "" one less worry '' off of their customer 's worrying about their mortgage and to instead for me to focus on taking care of myself and my family during this "" trying time I was going through ''. 

On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I started receiving emailed credit alerts from all three credit bureaus advising me of a major delinquency suddenly being reported from Wells Fargo as over "" 120 days late ''. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX and he apparently knew about the situation and was working to get it resolved. He advised that someone had incorrectly "" coded '' my loan incorrectly. He advised this should be a simple fix and should be corrected within a couple of days and would call me Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX for an update. As understandably upset as I was, I mentioned to him if not, I would be taking action and filing complaints for immediate investigation.The following day Friday XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by "" XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo Executive Offices XXXX ext. XXXX '' to advise there had indeed been a mistake by them reporting me to the credit bureau as delinquent when in fact there should be "" NO '' credit reporting at all and the status on my report should be "" current paid as agreed '' as of XX/XX/XXXX as my loan was when I accepted and was put on their disaster relief plan on XXXX. She told me she was going to "" light a fire '' under the credit bureau reporting team and get back to me Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX as well to advise the correction had been done. When I arrived home from work that day I had a letter from Wells Fargo advising that my loan had been "" sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX '' and to contact them regarding my mortgage loan after XX/XX/XXXX. 
Tuesday afternoon came and after not hearing from XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, I reached out to both. I emailed XXXX XXXX and he called and left me a voice mail that "" the mistake was being corrected but had no date when it would be completed ''. I then reached out to XXXX XXXX. This time she was rude and advised me she was busy and had "" over 40 cases '' and had no updated information and would "" have to get back to me '' Friday XX/XX/XXXX. She went on to advise she was aware my loan was being transferred from Wells Fargo and if I had any questions to "" contact them '' after 3-1. 

I received no phone call from XXXX XXXX last Friday as promised and now she will not return my call. She had no sense of urgency or concern when I spoke to her about the situation last time we spoke. 
I feel that they are aware my loan is being transferred to another loan servicer in a matter of days and are not working to correct their mistake before this happens. 
I desperately need help in getting their mistake corrected as this is causing an enormous amount of stress for me as I am already XXXX with major health problems.

It is now over {$70000.00} due to accrued interest. Interest has been a nightmare for me and I am sure plenty of other students. I was tipped early on to pay attention to interest and pay it down while in school, and I did so. I even paid some of the smaller school loans off in full before my loan went into effect in 2013. From the get-go, I have always been on an income based plan. At that time, there was no way I could afford rent, utilities, daycare, etc. along with a $ 700+ school loan payment each month. When I was first applying for the income based plan, I spoke to a representative about it in general. He explained to me that the payments are lowered but only low enough to cover interest. As such, I was always under the impression that the payments were only as low as the interest that accrues each month. Otherwise, what's the point? I do not like to let interest accrue. I do not want to risk having any accrued interest capitalized. I would not have agreed to this if I knew better. I feel I was misguided. Anyway, I started the plan. I set myself up for automatic payments. I went on with life until I felt I could start paying down my loan. After some time, I noticed the balance on my loan jumped from XXXX to over 70k. How did my balance increase after I have been making payments on it regularly? I called to question it and learned that it is due to {$6000.00} of accrued interest! My payments are less than the amount of interest accrued each month, so it has been racking up without my knowing. Who knows if it has even been capitalized. I keep trying to find documentation to figure out so, but I can't find anything to help me much. The rep says it isn't capitalized. So here I am ... ready to try to tackle some of my principal, and I can't, because I have a ton of accrued interest to work on before I can even touch principal. I feel helpless. What's the point of having an income based or other plan when you are struggling financially? All you are doing is paying and/or accruing interest ... never touching your principal. I thought the income based plan lowered payments yet still applied to a portion of principal and interest in a pro-rated fashion to what the regular payment amount would be.

I had planned to build a house and move there with my wife upon our retirement. However, XXXX XXXX refused to advance payments against the mortgage for the construction. XXXX bought this loan from XXXX, out of bankcruptcy. 

We had originally taken out a construction to permanent loan with the now defunct XXXX. The loan was saddled with very high fees and closing costs. Also, the interest rate was initially high at 7 %, despite my, at that time, very high credit rating. XXXX issued payments to the mortgage broker ( commissions ), the real estate agent who sold us the lot as well as an initial draw to the original contractor that was supposed to build the house. Those draws were issued against my loan with nothing in return to me, resulting in a much higher balance than if I had just bought the lot. The contractor never did any construction but pocketed the money advanced to him by XXXX. 

After XXXX went bankrupt in XXXX, XXXX Bank purchased the loan for XXXX cents on the dollar. Even though this was a construction to permanent loan, XXXX XXXX refused to pay for the construction of the house. At that point, I had already paid out several XXXX dollars out of pocket to the contractor for site preparation. So I got stuck with the sunk cost of not only XXXX of dollars in unnecessary loan costs, but also the sunk cost of the site preparation. 

Even though XXXX Bank reduced the interest on the loan, they have collected more in interest on this loan than what they had originally paid for the entire loan. Over the past 10 years, I had asked XXXX XXXX three times to reduce the outstanding principal or to take the property back ( deed in lieu ), but they had always refused. 

I am XXXX XXXX old and my wife and I only receive Social Security income and a few XXXX dollars in rental income per month. Our out of pocket medical expenses are mounting and in order to continue making payments on the above-mentioned loan, we will soon be forced to sell our home.

In XX/XX/XXXX I called Loancare customer service and they said that a glitch had occurred that kept my account from being updated and it was fine, the HOA insurance was sufficient and I would receive no further correspondence.

I also received a postcard from XXXX  also dated XX/XX/XXXX, saying they added a fraud alert that I requested. I only requested removal of one. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I spent well over an hour trying to get help from Experian, eventually reaching XXXX after the call initially went overseas.

Ive heard from the way too many Experian reps that Ive spoken with that they system times out, too many attempts, black and white images, TIFFS and PDFs, nothing over 15MB All of which I abided by. Then he posed security questions of which I apparently failed. I will contend the data, your data, was incorrect.

In XX/XX/2019 I requested a pay off demand and a reinstatement demand on my loan. I received a pay off demand with a balance of {$200000.00} that was good through XX/XX/2019. And a reinstatement demand that was good through the same date at {$19000.00} for the loan and {$1900.00} for other miscellaneous amounts.

I called Ocwen and asked what the charge was for, they said attorney fees that had just come in. I asked if these attorney fees were included in the pay off demand and reinstatement demand? There answer was no.

I asked for them to be removed and they refused. I then pointed out that if the loan had just been paid in full with the pay off demand provided good through XXXX/XXXX/19, then they would not be able to charge these fees. The answer was yes that's correct. The result of this action is predatory and Owcen is bulling me into paying extra because I reinstated the loan instead of paying it off. 


If Ocwen failed to get an accurate pay off when it was requested that is their error and negligence. Ocwen needs to be held accountable for their mistake and honor their pay off demands. Had this loan just been paid in full they would have no recourse since a pay off demand is deemed good. So why are they now charging my account more?

This plan required no payments while under the plan and also offered "" credit bureau reporting protection '' suppressing all credit reporting while under the plan. The plan consisted of an automatic initial 90 day period at when concluded would then convert to a loan modification to extend the payments that had accrued unpaid during this time frame to the end of the loan. The modification plan consists of me making three monthly payments beginning in XX/XX/XXXX and ending in XX/XX/XXXX at which point the loan would be permanently "" modified '' putting the past due payments to the end of the loan. 
Since XX/XX/XXXX when I accepted XXXX XXXX 's offer to be put on this "" disaster relief plan '', I have on six different occasions been assured by my disaster relief reprsentative "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' XXXX that absolutely under no circumstances would any negative credit bureau reporting would take place as I repeatedly advised her that my credit was paramount and I most certainly did not want to be reported negatively to the credit bureaus. In fact she advised me "" NOT '' to make any payments during this process and "" NOT '' to worry about them reporting me past due to the credit bureaus assuring me with statements of "" XXXX XXXX has your back '', "" We are there for you during this trying time '' "" what has happened to you is not your fault and that is why we have this plan to help you '' etc. etc. 
Additionally, I attempted to reach her on two occasion 's the past few months and I was referred to her Manager "" XXXX XXXX '' ( XXXX ) XXXX the manager over the department as she was out of the office.

The second conversation I had with Mr. XXXX consisted of him informing me that my "" disaster relief modification '' was approved and that my credit was "" protected until XX/XX/XXXX '' to allow for completion of my disaster relief modification.

He advised this should be a simple fix and should be corrected within a couple of days and would call me Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX for an update. As understandably upset as I was, I mentioned to him if not, I would be taking action and filing complaints for immediate investigation.The following day Friday XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by "" XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX Executive Offices XXXX ext.

I was apprehensive about these phone calls as it seemed every month i was getting a call stating that it was the wrong program, so I waited to see if another payment was going to be drafted as it in fact was. I believed that since payments were coming out, that I was still in the program and i did not receive anything in writing stating otherwise. I then finally received a letter in the mail in XX/XX/XXXX stating that I was now in default and the balance was due of XXXX. The entire time payments were being made and I agreed to the program they advised me on. I don't think it is fair and practical to call three months  straight saying I was in the wrong program although i agreed to the terms and made payments.

This plan required no payments while under the plan and also offered "" credit bureau reporting protection '' suppressing all credit reporting while under the plan. The plan consisted of an automatic initial 90 day period at when concluded would then convert to a loan modification to extend the payments that had accrued unpaid during this time frame to the end of the loan. The modification plan consists of me making three monthly payments beginning in XXXX and ending in XXXX at which point the loan would be permanently "" modified '' putting the past due payments to the end of the loan. 
Since XXXX when I accepted XXXX XXXX 's offer to be put on this "" disaster relief plan '', I have on six different occasions been assured by my disaster relief reprsentative "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' XXXX that absolutely under no circumstances would any negative credit bureau reporting would take place as I repeatedly advised her that my credit was paramount and I most certainly did not want to be reported negatively to the credit bureaus. In fact she advised me "" NOT '' to make any payments during this process and "" NOT '' to worry about them reporting me past due to the credit bureaus assuring me with statements of "" XXXX XXXX has your back '', "" We are there for you during this trying time '' "" what has happened to you is not your fault and that is why we have this plan to help you '' etc. etc. 
Additionally, I attempted to reach her on two occasion 's the past few months and I was referred to her Manager "" XXXX XXXX '' ( XXXX ) XXXX the manager over the department as she was out of the office. During the first conversation with Mr. XXXX he again stated and gave me the exact same assurance as Ms. XXXX had and since I was under their "" disaster relief modification program '' and not under a "" regular modification program '' absolutely no negative credit reporting would take place. 
The second conversation I had with Mr. XXXX consisted of him informing me that my "" disaster relief modification '' was approved and that my credit was "" protected until XX/XX/XXXX '' to allow for completion of my disaster relief modification. '' Again stating how they were going "" above and beyond '' to assist their customer 's during this trying time to take "" one less worry '' off of their customer 's worrying about their mortgage and to instead for me to focus on taking care of myself and my family during this "" trying time I was going through ''.

I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX and he apparently knew about the situation and was working to get it resolved. He advised that someone had incorrectly "" coded '' my loan incorrectly. He advised this should be a simple fix and should be corrected within a couple of days and would call me Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX for an update. As understandably upset as I was, I mentioned to him if not, I would be taking action and filing complaints for immediate investigation.The following day Friday XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by "" XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXXo Executive Offices XXXX ext. XXXX '' to advise there had indeed been a mistake by them reporting me to the credit bureau as delinquent when in fact there should be "" NO '' credit reporting at all and the status on my report should be "" current paid as agreed '' as of XX/XX/XXXX as my loan was when I accepted and was put on their disaster relief plan on XXXX. She told me she was going to "" light a fire '' under the credit bureau reporting team and get back to me Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX as well to advise the correction had been done. When I arrived home from work that day I had a letter from XXXX XXXX advising that my loan had been "" sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX  as of XX/XX/XXXX '' and to contact them regarding my mortgage loan after XX/XX/XXXX. 
Tuesday afternoon came and after not hearing from XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, I reached out to both. I emailed XXXX XXXX and he called and left me a voice mail that "" the mistake was being corrected but had no date when it would be completed ''. I then reached out to XXXX XXXX. This time she was rude and advised me she was busy and had "" over 40 cases '' and had no updated information and would "" have to get back to me '' Friday XX/XX/XXXX. She went on to advise she was aware my loan was being transferred from XXXX XXXX and if I had any questions to "" contact them '' after XXXX. 

I received no phone call from XXXX XXXX last Friday as promised and now she will not return my call. She had no sense of urgency or concern when I spoke to her about the situation last time we spoke. 
I feel that they are aware my loan is being transferred to another loan servicer in a matter of days and are not working to correct their mistake before this happens.

Risky loan terms and structures : The practice of making credit card balances with terms or structures that make it more difficult or impossible for consumers to reduce their indebtedness. Citibank Cycle of Debt : Citibank used illegal debt collection tactics to create a false sense of urgency to lure overdue borrowers into debt traps. Citibank use XXXX debt collector to claim {$10000.00} They would encourage overdue consumers to temporarily pay off their loans and then quickly re-borrow from them again. Even after conveying to them that I could not afford to repay the balance, Citibank would continue to pressure me into taking on more debt only making me paying minimum balances for 10 years but the balance never goes down. I would pay new fees each time they took out another balance from them. I am sure you will find that Citibank created a false sense of urgency to get delinquent borrowers to take out more balances in the credit card is abusive.

I had secured a {$61000.00} HELOC, during the purchase of the condo, but because I lost my job in XXXX, I could not pay the monthly payment. I stopped paying and in XXXX I agreed with Sortis that the loan will be reduced to {$18000.00} and I would make monthly automatic withdrawals payments from my bank account. After about 5 years Sortis stopped collecting the monthly payment. As a result I thought that the agreement was resolved. Unfortunately, I did not know that they stopped collecting because they arrange payments in 48 month increments. 
Accordingly, I put my property on the market to find that the HELOC was still a debt on the property. I contacted Sortis and found out that of the {$18000.00} agreement I had paid {$17000.00}, 97 % of the agreed amount. Therefore, I asked Sortis if I could pay off the balance on the agreement to resolve this debt. I contacted Sortis XX/XX/XXXX asked for a resolution. Sortis said they needed to contact their client and would get back me and let me know what their client said about the offer to resolve the debt.

02/25/2019,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I have a 30 year fixed rate mortgage. I decided to get ahead and start a biweekly payment schedule to make an extra principle only payment annually. According to Wells Fargo 's website : "" ... When you split your payments like this, you're making the equivalent of 1 extra monthly payment ... This extra payment is applied directly to your principle balance. '' I started biweekly payments on XX/XX/XXXX and it is now XX/XX/XXXX. Only 1/2 of a monthly payment was applied to principle only on XX/XX/XXXX. There was not another principle only transaction during this period of over 1 year ( 35 1/2 payments ). I any given 12 months only 12 payment are due, or 24 1/2 payments. I made 26 half payments, which is 1 full payment over what I owed. A full principle only payment should have been applied at some point during that year of 26 payments. I am at 35 half payments with only 1/2 payment being applied directly to principle. I contacted Wells Fargo and they responded saying their actions are correct even though it conflicts with information on their website. They said 3 payments have to be made within one month in order to apply a payment to principle only. I don't feel like this practice is fair because on XX/XX/XXXX there was a payment made that could have been applied to principle only and the payments made on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX would have satisfied the XX/XX/XXXX balance due within the grace period.

02/25/2019,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"On XX/XX/XXXX I applied for a mortgage with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Initially on XXXX I told XXXX XXXX Loan Officer with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that I was having a dispute with my current landlord XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and that they were trying to evict me because I would not use their third-party utility service provider and pay extra fees. He ran my credit and said that I would need a credit score of XXXX at, at least two of the bureaus and XXXX XXXX would give me a loan. One thing for certain I do not owe XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX any money, that was clear on the order that the money matter was dismissed. If they want the money they must go before a judge and provide proof that I had violated the terms of the lease as of XX/XX/XXXX when they said they were going to proceed with the eviction notice per the expiration of the 10-day notice. 

When looking at my credit report XXXX XXXX said that I needed to pay off two accounts, XXXX   XXXX which turned into XXXX XXXX, XXXX and get a secured credit. That would boost my score quickly. Fortunately, by taking care of a few small issues I was able to boost my credit score to over XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX a text to let her know that my scores had gone up. She wanted to know if I wanted her to run a hard check with all three bureaus and I told her yes. She did so and on XX/XX/XXXX she sent me an email stating the following : Hi XXXX, I am excited to inform you that your Loan Officer, XXXX XXXX, or another member of our team will review your updated file and credit scores and will be in contact soon. Please keep their direct XXXX, for your records. 

Assuming all looks good, you will get a list of simple items to gather so we can issue your pre-approval letter. That is your golden ticket and the next step of your home-buying journey! 

It is likely that I will no longer be your primary point of contact after today, but youre always welcome to reach out if you have a question or need anything in the future. Additionally, if you know anyone else who could use my services, please dont hesitate to pass along my name and number. 

Best of luck and its been a pleasure working with you! 

Thank you very much, On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  received information on my credit via a credit report detailing all my outstanding debts. I am certain that all looked good enough for them to proceed because on XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX XXXX asking me to create an account and he provided me with the links to go onto their portal to do so. He also requested verification of my rent on XX/XX/XXXX making them aware that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was claiming that I owed them this back rent or that the rent was late however, they continued to process my loan anyway. Later that same day I received another email from XXXX asking me to provide information via a loan to do list. Later still that day I received another email from XXXX stating lets get you preapproved. I was preapproved and went about the business of locating a house. I subsequently went through several preapprovals until I finally found the right property for me and my family. 

When speaking with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX about providing him with my gold portfolio he mentioned that I needed to provide a steady payment history. He asked me if I had any utility bills in my name and I stated to him that I did not because XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX threatened to evict me if I did. I told him that I didnt have a rental History in the past 12 months because I had been living with my daughter in XXXX because of my XXXX. I then told him that I had been paying a monthly membership fee to XXXX XXXX XXXX for several years and he did not respond to that at all. I also provided XXXX with a rental history from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Il XXXX. Even though it was not the latest rental history, it was a rental history that showed I pay my rent-on time each month. In any event it was a solid and sound payment history. However, they refused to use that information and relied solely on information provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to deny me my loan. In VA Pamphlet 26-7, Revised Chapter 4 : VA guidelines for credit underwriting ; 4-40 paragraph c. how to analyze credit it states as follows : The applicants past repayment practices on obligations are the best indicator of his or her willingness to repay future obligations. Emphasis should be on the applicants overall payment patterns rather that isolated occurrences of unsatisfactory repayment. Determine whether the applicant ( and spouse, if applicable ) is a satisfactory credit risk based on a careful analysis of the credit report and other credit data. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was a landlord tenant dispute and does not show that I do not pay my rent it shows that there is a dispute. 

In a denial letter sent to me dated XX/XX/XXXX it states that XXXX XXXX XXXX decision to deny me credit was based on delinquent past or present obligations with others. It also stated in the letter that they used information to obtain a credit score from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and I had a credit score of XXXX which was above the XXXX I needed to qualify for a VA loan. They also added that I had derogatory public records or collections on file, lack of recent revolving account information, lack of recent bank/national revolving information and length of time since derogatory public record or collection is too short. All the information on my credit file representatives at XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX knew before they started the loan process, yet they continued to lead me to believe that I was getting the loan. 
For the last five years I have been paying on a membership financed through XXXX XXXX   XXXX for {$110.00} a month. That membership is financed by XXXX and interest is paid in accordance. Although they dont report it to a credit bureau, I believe that would qualify as a recent revolving account. I have also been paying a membership fee of {$160.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for four months and my car insurance of {$130.00} for five months, both of which would be a revolving account. Also, even though XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is saying that I owe them back rent you representatives at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was aware that there was a court order that says the money matter was dismissed so I dont owe XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX any money. They are also aware that I had been paying my rent to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on time. The problem came when I was sent an eviction notice saying they were going to proceed with eviction procedures per the expiration of the 10-day notice for failure to pay utilities in accordance with the lease. That is considered retaliation in a court of law especially when the lease gave me the right to use my own utility company. I sent XXXX a copy of the lease, so he is aware of my rights under the lease. I also sent him a copy of the email where XXXX XXXX Senior property manager for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX stated that they were going to proceed with the eviction procedure per expiration of the 10-day notice. Not at any point and time did XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ever send me an eviction notice for failure to pay rent. 

I dont think that the fact that I didnt have a credit card should have caused me any issues since I would not want a high debt to income ratio. As an economist doing research, evidence from studies of mortgage loans suggest that borrowers with a higher debt-to-income ratio are more likely to run into trouble making monthly payments. So why would I want to keep adding accounts, so I can fail? As far as outstanding debts I was told by XXXX XXXX to pay off XXXX and XXXX XXXX which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. I acquired a secured credit card at the request of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX officers. However, the plan was to get one anyway not because I wanted to boost my credit but because it makes it easier to rent cars. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me an email stating they were ordering an appraisal on the property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Il XXXX even though they already knew all the issues with my credit and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX they proceeded on leading me to believe that I would get my home financed. If those issues were that serious the time for them to stop the loan process was on XX/XX/XXXX when they first found out about XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX claiming that I was late on my rent. However, there was no issue until I sent in my identification and they realized I was a XXXX year old XXXX XXXX Male. 

On XX/XX/XXXX three weeks after XXXX knew that I was having an issue with my landlord he finally called and left me a message asking me about the late rent. When I called him on the XXXX of XXXX I told him that I would call him on Tuesday the XXXX of XXXX and explain to him about the late rent because I was unaware at the time that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was reporting my rent as being late. When I called XXXX on the XXXX I was with XXXX XXXX with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and I attempted to explain to him what happened. XXXX said he just needed to try to explain it to the underwriter to try to help me get the loan approved but that is was the underwriter that had the last word. In any event XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX allowed the appraisal to go through even though they already knew they were denying me the loan. They also kept leading me to believe that I was going to get the loan.

I then spent the next 10 years working with XXXX XXXX XXXX  as a XXXX XXXX XXXX for various companies. In XX/XX/XXXX I applied for the PSLF and was denied. I was told that I had the right repayment plan but the wrong type of loan despite consolidating the loans with the specific intent of meeting the requirements for the PSLF program. This was the first time that I realized that I was mislead by Citibank. 

At some point my loan was purchased by XXXX. I then consolidated my loans again and reapplied to the IBR plan with the specific intent of working towards the PSLF program. I was told by XXXX that everything was in order, that I met all the requirements and I restarted the clock. In XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX to check on the status of my progress as I was confused about why I had not received the yearly application to renew the IBP plan. I was informed that I still was not making progress as this time as I had the right loan but the wrong repayment plan. This was the second time that I realized I had again been deceived by my loan provider. I then called XXXX to inquire as to how this happened as I was laboring under the belief that I had everything in order. XXXX confirmed the consolidation was successful but that they never received the application for the IBR plan. I told them I didn't know how that was possible because 2 years ago I was told by Navient that everything was in order for the PSLF. The XXXX representative said that he was sure I was told that but that's not how it is now. He proceed to tell me that even though I don't have the IBR plan my current standard repayment plan also met the qualifications for the PSLF program. I told him he was wrong that I needed the IBR plan. He again said that the standard plan met the qualifications for the PSLF and  only after my insistence and double checking his facts did he acknowledged the mistake. This was the third time I was lied to by my loan provider. I have been mislead, misdirected, manipulated, and flat out lied to by my loan providers for the past 12 years. I have made career and life decisions based on the false information they provided me. Their actions are a flagrant abuse of power with the specific intent of deceiving the borrowers, bilking us out of our hard earned money, and forbidding us the financial debt freedoms awarded by the federal government.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NJ,07042,,Consent provided,Web,02/25/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3161486

This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX  Vs. XXXX  ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX  debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX   sent XXXX  a letter declaring that XXXX  disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX  should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX  proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX  on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). XXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX  ] in the XX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at 13. Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. The contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX  loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX  had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX   on this issue. I notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s. You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies.

We opened a claim with Wells Fargo and were told they would normally only go back 60 days, but it would be sent to a special team with a view to getting a total refund. Was also told that the pending {$60.00} could not be stopped and would have to go through our account. Making the claim was no easy task and my wife was refused access to speak about it, even though the account in question is in her name also. Was also told that if we wanted to avoid fraud, not to use Wells Fargo debit cards. 

We then contacted XXXX XXXX with a view to highlighting this fraud and after a few emails, they stopped replying. They have now been reported to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, with no resolution so far. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo refunded us just {$74.00}. This time we were told that the bank would only pay for transactions 60 days from the first fraud date - not 60 days back from the claim date as we were told. Essentially they agreed that the entire list of transactions were fraudulent, but they would only refund half of them as they had not been reported in a timely manner. This is despite us being covered by zero fraud liability and reporting this whilst a fraud was pending. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we visited our branch and spoke with the manager who assured us that zero liability means just that and he escalated our complaint to the Resolutions Teams. We provided a chronology of events, names, discussions and lies we had been told by Wells Fargo customer service agents. This was photocopied by the branch manager and sent to the Resolutions Team. We were assured we would have an answer within 1 business day.

3 business days later, we were informed after chasing them that our complaint had been forwarded to Operations Executive Office and they had until XX/XX/XXXX to respond. 

On the XX/XX/XXXX, again we chased them and again, the agent dealing with our claim was unavaiable. Undeterred, we waited on the phone to speak to someone else.

We were told this is as far as we could go with Wells Fargo. 

There was no mention about the test of the complaint or how we had been treated and lied to. We then contacted our bank manager with a view to shutting down all 4 of our Wells Fargo accounts and he could offer no compromise.

Flipping and charging interest so my balance never go down and still the same over 10 years : The practice of encouraging customers to frequently refinance balances and loans solely for the purpose of earning loan-related fees : 1 loan and balance 2 flipped loans and balance with fees and very high interest rollovers. On XX/XX/XXXX,  XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 1 b. Risky loan terms and structures : The practice of making loans with terms or structures that make it more difficult or impossible for borrowers to reduce their indebtedness. Citibank Cycle of Debt : Citibank used illegal debt collection tactics to create a false sense of urgency to lure overdue borrowers into debt traps. They would encourage overdue borrowers to temporarily pay off their loans and then quickly re-borrow from them again. Even after conveying to them that I could not afford to repay the balance, Citibank would continue to pressure me into taking on more debt only making me paying mimimun balances for 10 years but the balance never goes down. I would pay new fees each time they took out another balaance from them. I am sure you will find that Citibank created a false sense of urgency to get delinquent borrowers to take out more balances in the credit card is abusive.

02/25/2019,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I transferred by federal student loans over to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX in order to participate in their public service loan forgiveness ( PSLF ). I had been making on-time, qualifying payments ( at least the minimum amount due, income-based repayments ) through my previous loan provider, XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX ( it may have been a different provider originally, but XXXX has been my main loan provider for the last several years ). Since transferring my loans over to XXXX XXXX XXXX, they validated my employer/job as eligible for the program. According to the details of the PSLF program, I should be eligible for loan forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX, after working for 10 years in a XXXX/XXXX XXXX position and having made 120 qualifying payments ). 
However, they have miscalculated the number of my qualifying payments I have made, despite repeated calls to customer service about this issue. Each time I call, I am told that they need more time in order to appropriately calculate my payments ( I am typically told 6-8 weeks ). Currently, my account shows that I have made 17 qualifying payments on my Direct Subsidized Consolidation Loan, thus indicating I have 103 more qualifying payments to make, indicating I would be eligible for loan forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX! It also indicates I have only made 24 qualifying payments on my Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan, which indicates I have 96 more qualifying payments to make. I have made consistent, on-time, full minimum amount due payments since consolidating my loans in XX/XX/XXXX. Each time I call in order to address this significant issue, I feel as though I am being given the "" run-around '' so-to-speak. I was initially informed that a computer calculates the qualifying payments through my previous loan provider, and then told that an actual person needs to go through and properly calculate the payments if the computer does not do them properly. I was told this would take 6-8 weeks, each time I've called. 
I have contacted Fed Loan Servicing, and specifically the PSLF department 4 times now. I called initially on XX/XX/XXXX to inform them my payments were miscalculated. I was assured this would be resolved within 6-8 weeks. I  called again XX/XX/XXXX, and was told that a Payment Tracking Review Form would be submitted to their accounting/payment department in order for a human to individually calculate my qualifying payments with my past provider ( XXXX ). I called again XX/XX/XXXX to follow up, and again was informed it would take 6-8 more weeks. I called again most recently on XX/XX/XXXX and I spoke to a customer service representative ( XXXX ID # XXXX ) and eventually a Service Delivery Team Member. ( XXXX ID # XXXX ). I was informed that it is now taking One year plus to complete payment reviews. I have never previously been informed of this, and XXXX informed me that we stopped giving people timeframes in XX/XX/XXXX so the person I spoke to in XX/XX/XXXX must have made a mistake ( mind you, I was given a 6-8 week time frame by multiple customer service representatives, as well as different information each time I called ). 
XXXX looked into my Payment Tracking Review, and informed me my payment review is still pending. What pending meant, according to her, is that someone has looked at my payment histories, and was still reviewing it to determine the number of qualifying payments. I informed her that I should be scheduled to be complete with my loan forgiveness next year in XX/XX/XXXX; I asked if there was any way my account could be expedited, given had I known it was going to take this long to review my qualifying payments, I would have requested a Payment Review Tracking form much sooner than I had ( for example, in XX/XX/XXXX when I initially called to alert them of the miscalculated payments ). She informed me this was not likely, given the number of customers they have and the number of individuals reviewing my particular case ; it was impossible to tell just where in the process they were. She informed me that 28 pending payments of mine were being reviewed currently. ( I have made many more than this ). She also informed me that between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX my payments did not appear to qualify because I did not pay the agreed upon amount. She said, and I quote, You paid more than the minimum amount which means those payment were placed in something called Paid ahead status and thus did not qualify as a qualifying payment towards the loan forgiveness. She informed me that given I paid MORE than the minimum amount during this period, the qualification could be changed, but it was unclear when/how this could occur. I was also informed that there were 4 forbearance timeframes where my payments did not count. I informed her I did file forbearances during tax season in order to get my taxes done prior to paying the updated amount for the year ( since it is an income-based repayment, it requires our taxes are completed to calculate the amounts ). However, I still made the minimum payment during that time anyway. She reported that Fed Loan could move or cut forbearance because payments were made, but again, it was not clear when/how this would occur. 
XXXX also informed me that applications for individuals who are in their 10th year of service ( thus completing their required payments/terms of services ) are reviewed first and given priority for properly calculating payments. She indicated that as I get closer to the end of my service ( In XX/XX/XXXX ), that I would have a better likelihood of having my final payments calculated properly ( if not by XX/XX/XXXX or later ). 
I was informed that I would be notified by mail when this process is complete, which likely would not be until XX/XX/XXXX ( at the earliest ) but also likely later, despite the fact that I originally transferred my loans over to them XX/XX/XXXX. Additionally, I informed her that my 2 loans are showing different qualifying payments when they should be the same ( as theyre consolidated so one payment goes to both loans ). She reported that is a common issue they were looking into for many borrowers. 
Currently, XXXX XXXX XXXX is the only provider approved by the Federal government/Department of Education to manage loans for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. This is the SOLE reason I transferred my loans to them, despite having heard similar complaints to mine from others. The fact that borrowers are being given different, and misleading information regarding their qualifying payments, and that now we are being told it will take over ONE YEAR to figure this out, seems fraudulent to me. Were it not for this program, borrowers may have chosen to remain with their prior lender/loan provider, or sought out a different one to manage their loans. It seems to be they are engaging in predatory practices by essentially forcing borrowers to use them for loan servicing in order to qualify for PSLF, however the method and process by which they determine eligibility appears to be mystifying at best, fraudulent at worst. In the meantime, they are collecting large amounts of interest on my outstanding loans, and apparently I can be punished if I pay an amount ABOVE my minimum payment amount. This keeps borrowers in a vicious cycle of being at the loan providers mercy in the meantime, all the while with no promise or guarantee of loan forgiveness, despite having followed and met criteria for fulling PSLF obligations.

02/24/2019,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"Well to start off I have been dealing with this for over a year now with this company. I have had to fax them numerous documents that they have requested from me. I have faxed them documentation to get the mortgage modified and assume it. I would fax this stuff and be told by different employees that they had everything they needed and that they would be sending a payment plan that I needed to follow for a certain amount months and then they would be able to do the assumption and modification. Then to only call a few days later and told my file was closed and I had to start all over again. This has happened at least 8 times. Then back in XX/XX/XXXX I called to see about negotiating the payoff and was told by another employee that they could do that but I needed to contact their attorney and have her request that from them. So I wasted over a week and half trying to get in contact with her to start that process because I was able to send them {$8000.00} at that point, only to find out from XXXX XXXX with the Wyoming VA that no they can't negotiate the payoff amount. Everytime I call I speak to a different person and no one seems to know what is going on. I got Probate open and they game me a forbearance program that I was to follow which started in XX/XX/XXXX. I have paid them {$5.00} a month every month since XX/XX/XXXX, sent to the exact address that they stated on my Forbearance. They have now stated that I didn't follow my forbearance and that I missed XX/XX/XXXX payment and are trying to forclose on my house XX/XX/XXXX. I have not missed one payment what so ever and have provided them proof of this. They received my XX/XX/XXXX  payment and they have cashed it, all of which I provided them. Also, I sent them XX/XX/XXXX payment in XX/XX/XXXX which they received and held on to and then refused it and sent it back to me. However, I did not get that payment back to me until the XXXX of this month. I was told by the postal service that they refused that payment and finally sent it back to me. So I sent XX/XX/XXXX payment and XX/XX/XXXX payment to them on XX/XX/XXXX but this time I sent them certified mail return receipt with asignature required. This way I have tracking and a name to find out who is doing this. I feel that they a doing this on purpose. Also, one day I will call and be able to speak to someone about my account and then the next day I will calm and they will say that I am not an authorized person on the account and they can't give me any information. They have been sent the court paperwork appointing me executor of my father 's estate at least six times. They have been sent that by me at least three times, XXXX XXXX with the VA at least 2 times and my probate attorney 1 time. And if I am not authorized on the account and they can't talk to me then how am I on a forbearance with them on this account. They have wasted my time and the VA '' s time. They are unprofessional, unethical and completely unorganized. They have misrepresented things to me on numerous occasions and given me the run around for over a year. I have worked in the escrow field for over 15 years and I have to say that I have never dealt with a poorer mortgage company in my life. I have also filed a complaint with there company as well. Not only I, but XXXX XXXX with the VA who is assisting me with all of this has requested to them to cancel the sale on XX/XX/XXXX and we have yet to get an aswer from them.

MY BIRTHDATE IS PRIVATE AND I WILL NOT ENABLE THE DYSFUNCTION I REPORT BY PROVIDING THE OFFENDING ENTITIES MY BIRTHDATE. 


XXXX XXXX is falsifying my identity and my credit report by reporting the personal information of another person to my credit report. I just had an extended conversation with XXXX about this in which it refused to stop injuring me in this way unless I talked to several other people in several other offices than the one I was speaking to. 

Specifically, because I am an authorized user on another persons credit card, XXXX reports the activity for that card to my credit report. This does me next to no good while signficantly harming me. XXXX reports a birthdate that is not mine to credit agencies. I have done everything that I reasonably should be expected to do to stop it from doing so, but it continues to falsify my identity in doing so. 

When I have reported the false birthdate to XXXX and other credit bureaus, they refused to remove it. They have no proof that I was born when they claim that I was born because they could not possibly have it, unless they are part of a larger criminal network which would not surprise me. Yet the CFPB gives the benefit of the doubt, for some XXXX reason, to predatory agencies like consumer reporting ones and a multi-billion dollar XXXX that will not pay for the kind of cyber security or even basic programming that it needs to run the kind of business it gets away with running. 

Neither should I be put in a position of having to prove my birthdate to credit bureaus for several reasons. First, my birthdate is private and credit bureaus are not entitled to have it. If they insist on reporting private information that they have collected without my permission from secretive and shady sources, they, not I, should be forced to prove the validity of what they report. Yet neither the CFPB, nor the FTC, nor any law enforcement agency has forced credit bureaus to verify, through an official source, what my birthdate is. If a credit bureau can not prove the birthdate that some XXXX  agency, whether it is XXXX XXXX, or any other one, dumps into my report, what are individual consumers suppose to do, other than to try to document it for a saner age? 

The CFPB should stop XXXX and any consumer reporting agency from reporting personal information such as a birthdate unless and until it can verify it from a legitimate source other than the gazillion sewage lines that are allowed to operate as consumer data collection agencies. Since law enforcement agencies have missed the point for half a century or more, this includes predatory agencies like XXXX, Experian and their ilk, as well as XXXX and its ilk. 

In addition, the CFPB should stop any agency that it can from abusing private information such as birthdates, passing them on, or making use of them in any way for their profit-making schemes. If the XXXX can manage to call out XXXX for privacy violations, why are US regulators still in the mud wallow that gave rise to it in the first place?

However, I recently noticed a message reporting partial payments are not applied to the loan but instead held in a separate suspense account until the balance is fulfilled and then it is applied to the balance. 

Is this legal? We live in Hawaii. I would think they must be benefiting from my extra money being held in there suspense account, in the form of interest in their favor. They surely must be generating interest on it. 

This defeats the purpose of bi-weekly payments. This strategy by the mortgage servicer is impeding the client/consumer/home owner from reducing interest on the mortgage and the length of the loan.

02/24/2019,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"To whom it may concern, I am writing this complaint and addressing "" Experian, XXXX  and XXXX  who are three of the elite credit bureau agencies who ultimately has a stronghold over your life by reporting credit information. To begin I am very VERY disappointed and dissatisfied with the way that Experian, XXXX and XXXX runs and conducts business. They are supposed to by LAW report ACCURATE and updated information regarding individuals credit files as well as conduct ACTUAL investigations so they will only be reporting fair and ACCURATE information according to the FCRA. 

However stating these facts it has come to my knowledge that these Credit Agencies are NOT conducting business as they should by law. I have been disputing the item listed below for approximately 5 months now with no correct resolution which is removal from my credit report. Please note that Experian, XXXX, XXXX nor any one speaking for or on the behalf of each company can say otherwise due to the fact that I do send and retain all of my dispute letters and responses on top of me ALWAYS sending my dispute letters via Certified Mail. The item listed below is and has been due for removal for a numerous amount of reasons. Please also note that all three Credit Bureaus always CLAIM that they have done an investigation which I know is not true and the reasons are listed below for the creditor. 

CREDITOR : 1. "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' : To begin, This item should have been removed from my Credit files due to it being PAST the Nevada statute of Limitations, and not to forget to mention that with this creditor I have absolutely no ties with or contract with. Also I have the paperwork that this creditor sent me which is absolutely FALSE AND COUNTERFEIT ( also sent to Experian, XXXX and XXXX in a prior dispute )! There are incorrect dates that do not correlate with the actual information and reporting, The "" Date of Contract '' clashes and voids the actual initial paperwork given ( which is counterfeit, against the law and considered erroneous information which each company should have noticed upon their "" dispute investigation '' ). If you look at the "" contract '' that this company sent to me you will notice that on page 1 of 6 ( which they did not send me all 6 pages of ) for the "" Date of Lease Contract '' ( when the Lease Contract is filled out ) it states the Date of XX/XX/XXXX which is not possible due to the fact on Page 6 of 6 ( what seems to be the contract signing page ) states that it was signed on XX/XX/XXXX. If you look closely to the left side of this sign date is physically states "" Date form is filled out ( same as top of page 1 ) '' Which it does not. That leads and proves that this document is counterfeit erroneous information as well as making the contract VOID! Also I would like to point out even more erroneous and information referring back to page 1 of 1 of the document sent to me from the creditor. If you refer to section 6 of the document you will see that it states the "" Rent and Charges '' are a total of {$790.00} for the total lease period. Now if you will refer to the document with the Header "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) '' noted below to the right it gives a list of all dates and amounts ( which again clashes, voids and proves that XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as the credit bureaus are reporting false information. ). This brings me to point out the incorrect information on this document in regards to my credit file. My move in date on this document states I moved in XX/XX/XXXX and my "" Lease End Date '' was XX/XX/XXXX with my rent being {$970.00}. Also please be aware that if and as shown that my Lease date ended on XX/XX/XXXX how is it possible that this creditor is showing on my credit report with an opened date of XX/XX/XXXX on Experian and XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX on XXXX when I had already moved out? The answer is it's not. Everything about this item on my credit is totally bogus, out of the Statute of limitations, erroneous and counterfeit information and needs to be removed.

02/24/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/2019, we were victims of a very sophisticated credit card extortion. This followed remote access to our computer by a group which had perfectly cloned all XXXX identifying information. Once in our computer under the guise of helping us eliminate hackers in our new and unfamiliar XXXX system, they identified and held hostage our largest bank account, demanding the purchase of gift cards to give them the security codes necessary to eliminate the hackers and reset our computer security. The most disconcerting and XXXX   producing element of this contact was that of five bank accounts stored in our computer, they had scanned files and quickly identified the account with the largest balance. Assurance was given that they would not use the card, just the security code, and a refund for the amount of the card would be sent immediately. After each transaction, a perfect appearing XXXX email was received with a refund receipt for the amount of the card. Given the sophisticated level of this group, and knowing they had identified our largest balance account, we felt we simply had no choice but to cooperate with these extortionists until we could reach XXXX XXXX bank to freeze our account. Considering this was armed robbery in a different dress, we felt it best to follow law enforcement advice to cooperate with the robbers until they can be neutralized. Once that was accomplished, we terminated contact with the extortionists and began notifying all pertinent institutions and law enforcement of this fraud and extortion. Upon examining our Visa transaction statement, we discovered an additional charge made after the criminals obtained our credit card data. Two purchases were made during this extortion at XXXX XXXX # XXXX, the transaction log lists three. All details are contained in supporting documents from law enforcement and agencies concerned.

Two credit card issuers were involved in this theft and extortion. XXXX  XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX  XXXX XXXX has been extremely understanding, cooperative, and absolutely efficient. Within 9 days of reporting this theft and forwarding all documenting evidence to XXXX, we received a letter from XXXX granting a refund to our account pending investigation completion. We have since been advised XXXX has determined our claim to be resolved in our favor as a valid reported case of fraud, theft by deception, and extortion. XXXX  further stated their appreciation for furnishing such detailed documentation to assist in their further investigation so as to protect other XXXX clients, and thanking us for our patronage. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX has been an entirely different matter. Our initial contact with the UMB staff member meant to handle fraud cases was regrettably dismissive, totally unempathetic to our situation, and obstructive to our efforts. As soon as she heard that our credit card was not stolen, but rather used under extreme duress in an extortion scheme, she showed no interest in listening to, or receiving our verified documentation of this fraudulent activity. Just a flat statement of nothing she could do to help us. Even refusing to assign this dramatic case of criminal activity a case number, thus giving the erroneous appearance to further investigation that we were negligent in reporting this fraud. When challenged in a subsequent contact regarding the lack of a case reporting number or file which appears to be a breach of common fraud reporting procedures, the agitated, terse response was, "" all I can do is send an email to them saying you disagree with our policy of not considering this fraud. '' When I again asked the identity of "" them '', I realized she had abruptly disconnected. After giving UMB two business days for a staff member to respond to no avail, I contacted and left a voice mail requesting assistance and a return phone call with the Director of Customer Service. Today we were contacted by a Customer service staff member. This staff member thankfully proceeded with a different approach. He spent time allowing us to explain the real facts surrounding our situation and thus gained proper perspective into the extraordinary circumstances surrounding our case. Our conversation was closed with the much appreciated assurance that he would have a review of our documentation which was previously submitted to the UMB Dispute Operations Center in XXXX. We have been UMB clients for 49 years, with very positive relationship with the bank for that entire period. Up until this unfortunate dramatic incident, we have never had an issue with their products or services, and have been a trouble free client. We have been diligent and responsible to maintain our current XXXX credit score. An unresolved fraudulent credit card charge has a dramatic impact on credit usage to credit available ratio, and thus impacts a credit score. This in turn has a domino effect in many other areas. Secondarily, without proper pursuit and investigation to uncover this sophisticated group, more UMB clients are exposed, potentially resulting in greater losses to the bank.

At this point, we are requesting CFPB assistance with UMB in determining this incident and charges incurred were made under extraordinary conditions of blackmail and extortion. Charges were made in order to protect our bank account, which in effect was being held hostage. Charges were made under forced coercion, rather than intentional and voluntarily. The charges in question in no way benefited the card holder. The only fair determination, considering the exceptional and unique circumstances in this case of criminal extortion, is to render the cardholder blameless and without malice.

I am in utter emotional distress that Wells Fargo was able to do this when we are in a debt counseling agency and willing to pay Wells Fargo for my debt incurred.

According to the garnishment law, they are suppose to only take no more than 25 % of the paycheck and not entitled to take the ENTIRE PAYCHECK and my wife 's too. Because we have a joint bank account they helped themselves and stole all our money. 

It is criminal Wells Fargo Bank would help themselves to our bank account. I will no longer bank with them since I know they are under criminal investigations for other bank fraud.

When negotiating the price, I explicitly told the dealer I wanted all charges rolled into the bottom line. I left the dealer with a new car and at the time, no further charges owed. I did not sign or receive any documentation countering my belief. I turned the vehicle into the dealership on XX/XX/XXXX. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a turn-in settlement invoice from VW Credit with a request for a {$1400.00} payment. I contacted VW Credit on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about the charges and I was basically told "" those are the charges, can't help you ''. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an updated bill for {$2200.00} with no explanation. On XX/XX/XXXX, I, again, contacted VW Credit and was told that the charges needed to be recalculated because they were totaled incorrectly. I was also told that I would receive a return call explaining said charges. I never received that call. Two months later, I called again. Bottom line, I asked for a detailed billing statement for all charges as I had not received one. I was also told that my vehicle was sold at auction for a loss and that total was factored in obtaining the payment total. That total was compared with excess mileage and excess wear. The excess mileage charge was included in the turn in payment and I disputed the damages as I turned in the vehicle in excellent driving condition. The VW Credit agent told me it took 7 days after I relinquished my vehicle to the dealer for someone to inspect it and come up with a bottom line. About a week after this call, I finally received a detailed billing statement. And to my surprise, a different total - {$1600.00}. 
Just to pile on even more, VW Credit referred this bill to a debt collector. 
When I talked to the debt collector, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, I told them that this account was in dispute and not call me anymore until resolved. The agent told me that I needed to pay off the debt for whatever amount even after I told him about the dispute. He could not give me a total amount even after I laid out the situation. He said pay the amount that was the most and worry about a resolved total later. He continued to press the issue of payment and I told him I would not pay it until resolved.

This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX Vs. XXXX ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX sent XXXX a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at XXXX. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). 

XXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX ] in the XX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at XXXX. Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and XXXX XXXX attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. 

The contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated XXXX XXXX. XXXX ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue. 

I notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s. 

You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies.

This collection agency replied with a statement stating, I quote. 

The laws are also very clear that requests made within the first 30 days of an account placed in collection have requirements. Those outside of that time frame do not. 

Now according to the FDCPA : If you fall delinquent on an account, it's likely that your debt will either be assigned or sold to a CA. The newly assigned CA will make the initial contact ( either by phone or mail ) to let you know that they are collecting your debt. 
The FDCPA requires that within five days of a CA initially notifying you that they are collecting your debt, they must send you an written notice containing these five things : FDCPA Section 809. Validation of debts [ 15 USC 1692g ] ( a ) Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing 1 the amount of the debt ; 2 the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; 3 a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector ; 4 a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector ; and 5 a statement that, upon the consumers written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor. 

Also stated according to FDCPA : Know that until a CA validates your debt with adequate proof, they can not collect the debt, contact you about the debt, or report your debt with the credit reporting agencies. If the CA has reported your debt to the credit bureaus before you sent them a Debt Validation letter, the CA is not allowed to verify or re-report the debt with the credit bureaus. If a CA has done any of the following, they are in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

As I have continuously stated for the record for over 25 months of repeated disputes to Transunion and XXXX, I was never contacted once this unknown delinquent account was place in collection by the original creditor, XXXX XXXX XXXX fail to notify me in the year of XXXX with a initial written letter or phone call once the negative account was Acquired by assignment or purchased as required by Law. 

Going back to all my disputes on record in XXXX, XXXX, that I can prove you receive it is clear you are in violation allowing this Collection Agency to continue their unfair negative reporting and absolutely deceptive practices to collect a debt. 

Therefore, this explains why XXXX XXXX XXXX repeatly wants to attach me to this debt by my initial phone call requesting the validity of the debt one year later after they acquired the debt and violated my rights according to FDCPA by immediately reporting the debt to the credit bureaus in XXXX without any initial written notification or phone call to make me aware of this unknown debt as required by FDCPA.

My issue here is that with an offer of an increased credit limit, my use should have been acceptance of the offer.

I did this numerous times and even sent the company contact names and numbers to call at the insurance company. I never received a response back until I started getting calls from debt collection companies. I just feel it's unfair for them to send me to collections without working with me to solve the issue.

02/24/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"I had an account with Lowe 's credit card ( ending in XXXX ) starting around XXXX. During the financial crisis of XXXX, I lost my job and could not afford to pay back the balance, the account was closed in XXXX and was forced to file chapter XXXX bankruptcy which was completed in XXXX. This Lowes account was included in the BK and was written off.

After the BK, I re-established credit and was issued a new card by Lowe 's ( the credit card portion was first issued by Lowe 's GECRB - now taken over by  Synchrony Bank with a new account number ending in XXXX ). My husband and I paid this bill through his XXXX Bill Pay account. In XXXX we bought a new fridge from Lowe 's. In order to pay it down quickly, I started making extra payments on the Lowe 's card through MY XXXX bill pay account. However, I inadvertently set the auto-pay to the OLD Lowe 's ( # XXXX ) account instead of the new one ( XXXX ) starting XXXX of XXXX. I set it to make auto payments of {$100.00} per month for 24 months ( except for the month of XX/XX/XXXX when I paid {$200.00} ). There were a total of 17 payments made by me for a total of {$1800.00} paid to Lowe 's.

This is a "" paperless '' billing account - no paper statements are issued each month - and around the first of XX/XX/XXXX I become curious as to why this account still had a $ 3,400+ balance since my husband had been paying an average of {$400.00} a month + my {$100.00}. So I logged on to Lowe 's and I don't see any credits for the payments I made, but, in the right hand corner of the Lowe 's screen, it shows "" CLOSED ACCOUNT XXXX ''. I went to click on the link to see what was there and you can not open it as it needs the 3 digit security code from the back of the card ( which I have not had since XXXX ). 

I logged into my XXXX bill pay and find out that my payments were going to this closed account since XXXX and simply not even being credited to anything. They were not returned to XXXX. They were not credited to my account. Nothing. 

I called Lowe's/Synchrony and explained the situation to them. I was put on hold for 12 minutes while the guy was checking it. He said he showed my {$100.00} payments were being made to my old account, that there was a "" zero '' balance due on that card and he could not tell me where the funds were transferred to each month after they were paid. Then he said he had to "" escalate '' it to another person who would take care of it. He then "" transferred '' me to the "" escalation supervisor ''. However, it simply disconnected. 

I called back and re-explained the whole situation, asking if there were any notes from the first guy I spoke with. She said there were some notes and she had to "" escalate '' this again but she also gave me a phone number of who she was transferring me to "" in case I lose you '' - which, of course is exactly what happened. 

So I called the number she gave me. I get a recording that its Synchrony Bank and I have to call back Monday thru Friday at XXXX XXXX as the other place I was calling was a foreign phone center and they can not handle anything like this ( but they never told me that ). These back and forth calls so far lasted 44 minutes. 

I decided to contact BofA bill pay and tell them the story and see if they have more power with them. The bill pay rep at XXXX was very understanding and professional and completed a three way call with me and Synchrony. Synchrony did not like this and made the rep and me jump through hoops many times to "" verify our identity ''. The XXXX rep and I again went through the same song and dance and were "" escalated ' and hung up on. After another 36 minutes of back and forth and getting nowhere, we gave up. 

We finally figured out that we needed to call back Monday the XXXX at XXXX when the Synchrony offices in the US were open. I called XXXX bill pay back and got a new XXXX rep named XXXX from XXXX on the line. She had the notes made by the other XXXX Bill Pay person from Sunday and pulled up all the copies of the payments I made to Lowe 's totaling {$1800.00}. We again got bounced from one dept to another to another, then given the phone number to their outside collection agency ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) who they said the payments were transferred to - without any notice to me or XXXX  . We called XXXX, they asked for all my identifying information and, after 18 minutes of her stonewalling, being obnoxious, etc, said she had no record of any payments and couldn't tell us anything as this was a closed account (??? ) and referred us back to Synchrony collections dept ( so far, by this point, we have been on the phone with them a total of 51 minutes ).

SO, we called back the Synchrony collection department, re-explained the situation again and he was telling us we had to call the XXXX people again. XXXX put a stop to this and told him "" we already spoke to those people and they have referred us back to you. We have been on this call for 1 hour and 6 minutes. We do not want to be transferred again. I want you to give me your fax number so I can fax you the proof of payments so you can credit our mutual customer for these payments ''. He finally relented and gave us his fax number and said I would definitely hear back from them within three business days. It has been 14 days with no response whatsoever. 

I have the printouts from XXXX XXXX XXXX to verify all payments were made and that neither they nor myself was ever notified that these payments were going to a closed account. In addition, these payments were made payable to "" Lowe 's '' - the credit card company back in XXXX when I opened it was not even owned by Synchrony. It was XXXX.

This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX Vs. XXXX ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX sent XXXX a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). 

XXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX ] in theXX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at XXXX. Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and XXXX XXXX attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. 

The contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue. 

I notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s.

You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies.

However, my official complaint makes claim against PayPal located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX California and Dispute Department Representative XXXX. The reason for charging Paypal is that XXXX is a XXXX shell Company that is committing fraud through the PayPal organization. Paypal is aiding and abetting this fraud. 
XXXX set-up a website ( that is currently offline ) and it appears to be linked to legitimate companies. In this case, XXXX superimposed logos of the XXXX XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX to make their site appear that they sell officially licensed products. 
I placed my order on XX/XX/XXXX and used PayPal as my payment option. The order was for a Womans Medium Officially Licensed # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Jersey. At that time, I did not know that I was purchasing from a XXXX company. I did not realize this until I saw the charge on my PayPal account with what I assume to be the companies name. I can not read it because it was written in XXXX. I received an email saying that shipping would take 7-10 days however the package did not arrive for 3 weeks. When I saw the Jersey it is clearly a knock-off. More specifically, these jerseys were stolen and now being resold. 

in XX/XX/XXXX, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 's ( ICE ) Homeland Security Investigations, with an assist from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Postal Inspection Service, seized 226 boxes containing 4,016 counterfeit jerseys. It also includes 160,000 XXXX XXXX-related pieces of memorabilia discovered in recent days. 
"" Organized criminals are preying on that excitement, ripping consumers off with counterfeit merchandise and stealing from the American businesses who have worked hard to build a trusted brand, '' said ICE director XXXX XXXX, in a statement. "" The sale of counterfeit jerseys and other sports items undermines the legitimate economy, takes jobs away from Americans, and fuels crime overseas. 
When the package arrived, the shirt was extremely small. It looks like a baby shirt. It was not what I ordered. This is where the scam takes place. They never intend to send you what you ordered as they just send you whatever they have from the stolen merchandise they have in stock. At this point, I was given 3 options see a copy of the email from these criminals below : From : XXXX XXXX Sent : Monday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX To : XXXX Subject : Re : RE : Paypal complaint for order # XXXX Hi, OK, as the problem we have three choices for you.

1 ) You can return the item to us and pay for the international shipping fee. We will refund you after we receive the item you returned to us. 
2 ) You can keep the item and we can give you 10 % of your payment for compensation. 
3 ) Keep the item and add 85 % of your total payment to our XXXX XXXX first, after we check the payment, we will send another new item to you .Thanks. 

Return the Item for a full refund To return it must go through customs. International Shipping will cost close to {$75.00} - {$120.00} once all shipping costs are figured. What is for sure it will be more than the cost of the Jersey? No customer is going to choose this option because it doesnt make financial sense. 
Keep the Item and accept a 10 % compensation payment - I was offered 15 % or {$6.00}. This isnt compensation to XXXX   it represents a profit of {$39.00}. Think how many times they catch unsuspecting Americans {$40.00} a pop adds up. 
Keep the item and add 85 % and get scammed again XXXX wants you to send them money through XXXX XXXX. What legitimate company uses XXXX XXXX?? They dont. What legitimate company tells you to keep the merchandise and reorder? No company does that. If you send them money again they will end all communication with you and you will never receive anything. 
I disputed the charge and with Paypal and they defended this fraudulent behavior. When I brought these issues up to PayPal Disputes Department, I was told quote We dont decide what is fraud and what is not? If Paypal doesnt make a decision in cases like this what was the department setup for. Attached please see a list of over 70 customers who XXXX has defrauded. It is the same story as mine, same scam and Paypal is enabling this behavior. The person who is writing these emails is not a company. He is a criminal!

02/24/2019,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Greetings, Well, after 3 mouths the facts have not been answered on this matter. I have sent Nation Star Mortgage documents of all facts on this issue. The fact that you have not rebutted proof of claim point by point. I will now inform you I'm of the age of Majority, of sound mind and competent to testify. The fact of the matter is I signed a promissory note for value and Nation star Mortgage has accepted the note as Legal Tender. All Promissory notes are a tender of payment of a obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument, the effect of tender is governed by principles of law applicable to tender of payment under a simple contract. The promissory note under Title 7 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS 1951.15- Return of paid-in-full or satisfied notes to borrower. The notes will be returned to the borrower after the payment in full or execute an appropriate affidavit regarding the lost notes. I have requesting a affidavit of truth requesting that you produce my wet ink note which has been dis-honored. Code of federal regulations 1901.503 Definitions. ( 1 ) - ( 19 ) insurance of notes and 1901.508 Servicing of insured notes outstanding with investors. The holder will endorse the insured note as follows : "" Pay to the order of the United States of America. Without recourse ''. As the facts I have stated in our contract # XXXX Conditional Acceptance for the Value/Agreement/ Counter Offer to Acceptance of Offer. The Obligation 's of public debt of the United States of America is discharged though the banks. Nation star Mortgage Services has refused to answer my questions with detailed specific answers, we will presume that there is a concealment of material of facts and that the promissory note has been altered and stolen and that I provided the money that Nation star Mortgage claims have lent to me. If you claim that there is an agreement and a loan, then you must stop concealing material facts, answer my questions, and tell me if the promissory note was recorded as a loan from me to Nation Star or the Promissory note was stolen. According to my records, the promissory note was stolen or recorded as a loan from me to Nation Star and that Nation Star never paid one cent as adequate consideration to purchase the promissory note from me creating the economics similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling. I am now demanding that you either stop concealing material facts and answer my questions if you claim that there is an agreement or that you return the stolen promissory note. If you claim that the promissory note was a loan from me to Nation Star Mortgage, I demand that you immediately repay the loan by returning the promissory note and stop the damage to me. I am hereby offering to discharge the alleged debt provided that you give specific answers to my questions regarding the alleged debt and I will payoff or discharged the alleged debt using the same specie of funds or money or money equivalent that Nation Star Mortgage used to fund the alleged loan or similar instrument thus ending all liens and interests. One of the requirements of a negotiable instrument is that the instrument must be payable for a fixed amount of money. My question is, from your point of view according to your understanding of the agreement, is money deposited recorded as a bank asset or as a bank liability? Please list all forms of money or negotiable instruments you and Nation Star Mortgage are involved in, issuing the alleged loan, use as or like or as a substitute as money or credit used to fund checks or bank drafts. Specifically, did you or Nation Star Mortgage use my promissory as a bank asset which was offset by a bank liability? Specifically was my promissory note used to fund a check or bank draft? If my promissory note was used to fund a check, then I provided the money to fund the so called loan and you never lent me one cent of your money to purchase the note from me. Therefore, the economics are similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling against me, which I never agreed to and which is not part of the agreement. According to me if you used my promissory note to fund a check, you stole my promissory note or you recorded it as a loan from me to you and you still owe me money that you never lent me. Stealing changed the cost and the risk of the transaction. I want to know specifically did you intend to create the economics similar to stealing my promissory note as part of the agreement? Please answer yes or no. If you refuse to tell me, then we have fraud in the factum, which makes you no longer the holder in due course. No title passes with a theft. Since the promissory note is forged, and no good title passes with a forged document, you are not the holder. I demand that the stolen forged promissory note now be returned or you answer all of my questions in this notice and previous notices explaining the terms and conditions of the alleged agreement concerning the economics similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling. To be a holder in due course you must perform the following 3 deeds : 1. Purchase the promissory note from me. 2. Take the promissory note  in good faith using honesty, absence of malice and the absence of design to defraud or seek an unconscionable advantage ( See XXXX XXXX XXXX for good faith ) and 3. Have no notice of any defenses against payment of other claims on the promissory note. Nation Star Mortgage agreed to the following general terms and conditions of the loan agreement : 1. Nation Star Mortgage must use their money or credit as adequate consideration to purchase the agreement from me to repay the loan. 2. Nation Star Mortgage involved in the alleged loan did not accept anything of value from me that would be used to fund a check or similar instrument in approximately the amount of the alleged loan. 3. Nation Star Mortgage must follow Generally accepted accounting principles as required by CPA audit opinions. 4. The intent of the agreement is the party who funded the loan is to be repaid the money. 5. All material facts are to be disclosed in the writing agreement.6. The holder must repay the loan in the same specie of money or credit or thing of value the financial institution involved in the loan used to fund the loan check or similar instrument, thus ending all interest and liens. 7. The loan transaction does not create the economics similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling. The agreement that I entered into has the above seven elements in it. According to the bookkeeping entries, Nation Star Mortgage breached all seven basic elements of the agreement and Nation Star Mortgage and then concealed material facts of the agreement. I am demanding adequate assurance of due performance that the above seven elements are part of the loan agreement or I demand that the Nation Star Mortgage return a XXXX loan balance. 
The question is Why you Can not produce the promissory note? Answer is because they are a bill of exchange, legal tender and used to discharge public debt. NOTICE OF MEMORANDUM OF LAW POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL BILL OF EXCHANGE Points and Authorities in Support of International Bills of Exchange or International Promissory Note Those who constitute an association nationwide of private, unincorporated persons engaged in the business of banking to issue notes against these obligations of the United States due them ; whose private property is at risk to collateralize the governments debt and currency, by legal definitions, a national banking association ; such notes, issued against these obligations of the United States to that part of the public debt due its Principals and Sureties are required by law to be accepted as legal tender of payment for all debts public and private, and are defined in law as obligations of the United States, on the same par and category with Federal reserve notes and other currency and legal tender obligations. RE : Item tendered for Discharge of Debt. TENDER OF DEBT BY THE PEOPLE i.e. the SURETY IS AN OBLIGATION OF THE U.S. TREASURY ( The instrument tendered to whomever, and negotiated to the United States Treasury for settlement, is an Obligation of THE UNITED STATES, under Title 18USC Sect.8, representing, as the definition provides, a certificate of indebtedness .drawn upon an authorized officer of the United States , ( in this instance the Secretary of the Treasury ) issued under an Act of Congress ( see : public law 73-10, HJR-192 of 1933, Title 31 USC 3123 and 31 USC 5103 ) and by treaty ( see : UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND INTERNATIONAL PROMISSORY NOTES ( UNCITRAL ) and the Universal Postal Union headquartered in XXXX, XXXX ) . TITLE 18 & gt ; PART I & gt ; CHAPTER 1 & gt ; Sec. 1. & gt ; Sec. 8. Sec. 8. Obligation or other security of the United States defined The term obligation or other security of the United States includes all bonds, certificates of indebtedness, national bank currency,  Federal Reserve notes, Federal Reserve bank notes, coupons, United States notes, Treasury notes, gold certificates, silver certificates, fractional notes, certificates of deposit, bills, checks, or drafts for money, drawn by or upon authorized officers of the United States, stamps and other representatives of value, of whatever denomination, issued under any Act of Congress, and canceled United States stamps. The International Bill of Exchange is legal tender as a national bank note, or note of a National Banking Association, by legal and/or statutory definition ( UCC 4-105, 12CFR Sec. 229.2, 210.2, 12 USC 1813 ), issued under Authority of the United States Code 31 USC 392, 5103, which officially defines this as a statutory legal tender and is issued in accordance with 31 USC 3123 and HJR 192 ( 1933 ) which establish and provide for its issuance as Public Policy in remedy for discharge of equity  interest recovery on that portion of the public debt to its Principals and Sureties bearing the Obligations of THE UNITED STATES. This is a statutory remedy for equity interest recovery due the principles and sureties of the United States for discharge of lawful debts in commerce in conjunction with US obligations to that portion of the public debt it is intended to reduce. During the financial crisis of the depression in XXXX, gold, silver and real money were removed as a foundation for our financial system. In its place the substance of the American citizenry : their real property, wealth, assets and productivity that belongs to them was, in effect, pledged by the government and placed at risk as the collateral for US debt, credit and currency for commerce to function. This is well documented in the actions of Congress and the President at that time and in the Congressional debates that preceded the adoption of the reorganizational measures : Senate Document No. 43, 73rd Congress, 1st Session, stated, Under the new law the money is issued to the banks in return for Government obligations, bills of exchange, drafts, notes, trade acceptances, and bankers acceptances. The money will be worth XXXX cents on the debt because it is backed by the credit of the nation. It will represent a mortgage on all the homes and other property of all the people in the Nation. ( Which lawfully belongs to these private citizens. ) The National Debt is defined as mortgages on the wealth and income of the people of a country. ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ) Their wealth, their income. The reorganization is evidenced by : The Emergency Banking Act, XX/XX/XXXX, House Joint Resolution 192, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX public law 73-10 ) And the series of Executive Orders that surrounded them : 6073- Reopening of Banks. Embargo on Gold Payments and Exports, and Limitations on Foreign Exchange Transactions. XX/XX/XXXX 6111-Transactions in foreign exchange are permitted under Governmental Supervision. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates. XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, Congress had passed An Act to provide for the establishment of Federal reserve banks, to furnish an elastic currency, to afford a means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes. The Act is commonly known as the Federal Reserve Act. One of the purposes for enacting the Federal Reserve Act was : ( 3 ) to authorize hypothecation of obligations including United States bonds or other securities which Federal reserve Banks are authorized to hold under Section 14 ( a ) ; 12 USC ; ch. 6, 38 Stat. 251 Sect 14 ( a ) The term hypothecation as stated in Section 14 ( a ) of the Act is defined : 1. Banking. Offer of stocks, bonds, or other assets owned by a party other than the borrower as collateral for a loan, without transferring title. If the borrower turns the property over to the lender who holds it for safekeeping, the action is referred to as a pledge. If the borrower retains possession, but gives the lender the right to sell the property in event of default, it is a true hypothecation. 2. Securities. The pledging of negotiable securities to collateralize a brokers margin loan. The broker pledges the same securities to a bank as collateral for a brokers loan, the process is referred to as re-hypothecation. [ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, pg. 228 ( XXXX ) ] As seen from the definitions, in hypothecation there is equitable risk to the actual owner. Section 16 of the current Federal Reserve Act, which is codified at 12 USC 411, declares that Federal Reserve Notes are obligations of the United States. So we see the full faith and credit of the United States, which is the substance of the American citizenry, their real property, wealth, assets and productivity that belongs to them, is thereby hypothecated and re-hypothecated by the United States to its obligations as well as to the Federal Reserve for the issuance and backing of Federal Reserve Notes, as legal tender, for all taxes, customs, and other public dues.

The commerce and credit of the nation continues on today under financial reorganization ( Bankruptcy ) as it has since XXXX, still backed by the assets and wealth of the American citizenry, at risk for the governments obligations and currency. Under the 14th amendment and numerous Supreme Court precedents, as well as in equity, Private property can not be taken or pledged for public use without just compensation, or due process of law.

The Courts have long ruled to have ones property legally held as collateral or surety for a debt, even when he still owns it and still has it, is to deprive him of it since it is at risk and could be lost for the debt at any time. The United States Supreme Court said, in United States v. XXXX [ 13 Wall, 623, 627 ], Private property, the Constitution provides, shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. The right of subrogation is not founded on contract. It is a creature of equity ; is enforced solely for the purpose of accomplishing the ends of substantial justice ; and is independent of any contractual relations between the parties. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX v. XXXX, 120 U.S. 287, 301-302 ( XXXX ). The rights of a surety to recovery on his risk or loss when standing for the debts of another was reaffirmed again as late as XXXX in XXXX v. XXXX XXXX. XXXX, 371 U.S. 132, when the Court said : sureties compelled to pay debts for their principal have been deemed entitled to reimbursement, even without a contractual promise And probably there are few doctrines better established XXXX XXXX XXXX, 5th edition, defines surety : One who undertakes to pay or to do any other act in event that his principal fails therein. Everyone who incurs a liability in person or estate for the benefit of another, without sharing in the consideration, stands in the position of a surety. Constitutionally, and in the laws of equity, the United States could not borrow or pledge the property and wealth of its private citizens, put at risk as collateral for its currency and credit, without legally providing them equitable remedy for recovery of what is due them. The United States government, of course, did not violate the law or the Constitution in this way in order to collateralize its financial reorganization, but did, in fact, provide such a legal remedy so that it has been able to continue on since XXXX to hypothecate the private wealth and assets of those classes of persons by whom it is owned, at risk backing the governments obligations and currency, by their implied consent, through the government having provided such remedy, as defined and codified above, for recovery of what is due them on their assets and wealth at risk. The provisions for this are found in the same act of Public Policy HJR-192, public law 73-10 that suspended the gold standard, abrogated the right to demand payment in gold, and made Federal Reserve notes for the first time legal tender, backed by the substance or credit of the nation. All US currency since that time is only credit against the real property, wealth and assets belonging to the private sovereign American people, taken and/or pledged by THE UNITED STATES to its secondary creditors as security for its obligations. Consequently, those backing the nations credit and currency could not recover what was due them by anything drawn on Federal Reserve notes without expanding their risk and obligation to themselves. Any recovery payments backed by this currency would only increase the public debt its citizens were collateral for, which an equitable remedy was intended to reduce, and in equity would not satisfy anything. And there was, as still, no longer actual money of substance to pay anybody. There are other serious limitations on our present system. Since the institution of these events, for practical purposes of commercial exchange, there has been no actual money in circulation by which debt owed from one party to another can actually be repaid. Federal Reserve Notes, although made legal tender for all debts public and private in the reorganization, can only discharge a debt. Debt must be paid with value or substance ( i.e. gold, silver, barter, labor, or a commodity ). For this reason HJR-192 ( 1933 ),  which established the public policy of our current monetary system, repeatedly uses the technical term of discharge in conjunction with payment in laying out public policy for the new system.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE,OH,43725,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,02/24/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3161736

02/24/2019,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"To whom it may concern, I am writing this complaint and addressing "" XXXX, Transunion and XXXX who are three of the elite credit bureau agencies who ultimately has a stronghold over your life by reporting credit information. To begin I am very VERY disappointed and dissatisfied with the way that XXXX, Transuion and XXXX runs and conducts business. They are supposed to by LAW report ACCURATE and updated information regarding individuals credit files as well as conduct ACTUAL investigations so they will only be reporting fair and ACCURATE information according to the FCRA. 

However stating these facts it has come to my knowledge that these Credit Agencies are NOT conducting business as they should by law. I have been disputing the item listed below for approximately 5 months now with no correct resolution which is removal from my credit report. Please note that XXXX, XXXX, transunion nor any one speaking for or on the behalf of each company can say otherwise due to the fact that I do send and retain all of my dispute letters and responses on top of me ALWAYS sending my dispute letters via Certified Mail. The item listed below is and has been due for removal for a numerous amount of reasons. Please also note that all three Credit Bureaus always CLAIM that they have done an investigation which I know is not true and the reasons are listed below for the creditor. 

CREDITOR : 1. "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' : To begin, This item should have been removed from my Credit files due to it being PAST the Nevada statute of Limitations, and not to forget to mention that with this creditor I have absolutely no ties with or contract with. Also I have the paperwork that this creditor sent me which is absolutely FALSE AND COUNTERFEIT ( also sent to XXXX, XXXX and Transunion in a prior dispute )! There are incorrect dates that do not correlate with the actual information and reporting, The "" Date of Contract '' clashes and voids the actual initial paperwork given ( which is counterfeit, against the law and considered erroneous information which each company should have noticed upon their "" dispute investigation '' ). If you look at the "" contract '' that this company sent to me you will notice that on page 1 of 6 ( which they did not send me all 6 pages of ) for the "" Date of Lease Contract '' ( when the Lease Contract is filled out ) it states the Date of XX/XX/XXXX which is not possible due to the fact on Page 6 of 6 ( what seems to be the contract signing page ) states that it was signed on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. If you look closely to the left side of this sign date is physically states "" Date form is filled out ( same as top of page 1 ) '' Which it does not. That leads and proves that this document is counterfeit erroneous information as well as making the contract VOID! Also I would like to point out even more erroneous and information referring back to page 1 of 1 of the document sent to me from the creditor. If you refer to section 6 of the document you will see that it states the "" Rent and Charges '' are a total of {$790.00} for the total lease period. Now if you will refer to the document with the Header "" XXXX XXXX Resident Disposition ( FF ) '' noted below to the right it gives a list of all dates and amounts ( which again clashes, voids and proves that XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as the credit bureaus are reporting false information. ). This brings me to point out the incorrect information on this document in regards to my credit file. My move in date on this document states I moved in XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX and my "" Lease End Date '' was XX/XX/XXXX with my rent being {$970.00}. Also please be aware that if and as shown that my Lease date ended on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX how is it possible that this creditor is showing on my credit report with an opened date of XX/XX/XXXX on XXXX and XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX on Transunion when I had already moved out?

02/23/2019,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"To whom it may concern, I am sending this email to document and make the CFPB aware of LoanCare being in violation of my rights and committing unjust actions. 

At the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX my County mailed me a notice informing me property taxes decreased by {$480.00}, and still to this day LoneCare is refusing to adjust my mortgage and currently charging me an extra {$480.00} for the entire year of XX/XX/XXXX and now for the begin 2 months of XX/XX/XXXX. When I received a new tax statement in the mail over 1 year ago informing me of my new tax obligations, I immediately contacted LoneCare, who refused to accept a copy of my documentation, and in fact I was told by your Company Representative, "" I'm sorry but we have to charge you the amount that's in our system, not by the amount on the statement received from the County 's District Appraisal. '' I don't quite understand why LoneCare refused to accept my new documentation, but I am aware that their actions were and still are extremely unprofessional, negligent, and unjust. Also, as a paying consumer I confidently believe that at the very least my consumer rights were violated, therefore, LoneCare is in possible Breach of Contract and must be held accountable. For not only refusing to adjust my mortgage laterally according to my County 's Appraisal District, but also for then preceding on to increase my monthly payments by approximately $ XXXX/month. In which, then took it from $ XXXX/month to $ XXXX/month, with  claims that my escrow account balance was over Negative {$3000.00} a $ XXXX/annual increase of my Homeowners Insurance policy, I had acquired over the year prior. ( Yes, I changed policies during my renewal date, & I also put down {$800.00} of the {$1300.00} ), I knew It was a scam, but since they had waited so long I couldn't prove it, and with a escrow account there's so much money everywhere, it's easy to get confused on what money is going where and for which year the payment covers. But over time periodically tracking my account and the money they claimed I owed them, I was able to catch on to what they were doing to me. 

As my mortgage servicer how could you let me escrow balance get this far in the negative without necessary making adjustments in a timely matter, that would allow the consumer to effectively transition to the new increased homeowners insurance policy. However, LoneCare did not Act In Good Faith and they didn't give my family time to adjust to the new insurance increase, instead they continued to charge me at the same rate for months and months, causing my family to literally overnight have to go from paying $ XXXX/month to $ XXXX/month, ( for 1 year ) while still over charging us $ XXXX/yr for our taxes and paying the County Tax Appraisal $ XXXX/yr inl! As if they are trying to make us have to foreclose. Immediately after receiving this outrageous adjustment I contacted LoneCare, who assured me that their calculations were correct and that I owed them over {$3000.00}. They then agreed to allow us to pay $ XXXX/month for 2 years in order to meet their expectations. 

Now here we are 1 year later, and I am still be charged the same $ XXXX/yr tax rate, and they're still insisting that I owe them money, so now that I have paid the entire "" negative '' escrow balance, after submitting a {$1700.00} payment toward my escrow account that already had a balance of {$1200.00}, it turned into {$3000.00}, and it's only XX/XX/XXXX. After, paying the remaining "" negative escrow balance, '' they only agreed to decrease my monthly escrow payment by {$120.00}, which took it from $ XXXX/month to $ XXXX/month X 10 months remaining= {$3600.00} more in addition to the {$3000.00} current balance. In conclusion, LoneCare will have collected a total of {$6600.00} "" Escrow '' money from me over the course of 1-year, to cover my annual escrowed bill balance of {$3200.00}. This is less than half the amount that's LoneCare plans to take from me in XX/XX/XXXX. So basically LoanCare steals from me and I am responsible for replacing the stolen payments, while continually paying pre-established payments? 

These actions are not only negligent, they are unlawful, and causing my family of XXXX to struggle for an entire year is unjust. LoneCare refused and ignored and is still ignoring my request for a tax reassessment, while over charging severely unlawfully overcharging me.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LoanCare, LLC",TX,775XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/01/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3160988

XXXX was continually unable to deliver the internet speed or connectivity that I had paid for by their own "" Speed Test '' measurement metric. Over the course of the 2 months that I had XXXX, I logged over 17 calls to customer service, where their representatives both verified and logged that my speed was, at times, 1/10th of what I was paying for. I then proceeded to upgrade my package in an effort to get even the most limited internet service that I needed ; it did not work. XXXX sent 2 techs to my home, charged me for both, and I subsequently logged 7 more calls where the techs verified that my internet speed was meaningfully below what contracted speeds. After over 20 calls, 2 months and 2 tech visits, I informed XXXX that I would be cancelling my internet service due to their continued and verified inability ( by their own metric ) to deliver the internet speed for which we had contracted and I had paid. XXXX refused to waive their {$150.00} termination fee, despite clearly being unable to provide the service after having been given 40+ opportunities and still charging me for it. I refused to pay this, as XXXX had clearly not been able to hold up their side of the contract for which they were charging me to break. 

In early XXXX, I proceeded to file a Better Business Bureau complaint against the Company. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by a representative of their Company via phone and email who identified themselves as a manager. After speaking with her, she again refused to waive the cancellation fee for their services. Frustrated, and having logged countless hours on the phone with their XXXX, I agreed to pay the settlement amount that she offered me to clear the bill from my records, which was {$74.00} on an entire bill that they were trying to collect of {$190.00}. I received a confirmation from their Company for this one-time payment on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In early XXXX, I noticed that my credit report score had dropped from XXXX to XXXX due to my first an only attempt by a debt collector to report a debt. I learned that a Company called Diversified Consultants IN, in XXXX, FL, d/b/a, DCI, had been engaged by XXXX to collect the entire sum of this debt, {$190.00}, on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, XXXX negotiated a settlement with me, accepted payment for the settlement, but had already referred the debt for collection to DCI. 

I filed a dispute with XXXX where I uploaded documentation showing that I had complained to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, been contacted by the Company via email, and submitted a one-time settlement payment. XXXX  then contacted DCI ( not XXXX ), leading them to issue a resolution confirming that the debt exists on XX/XX/XXXX and subtracting the {$74.00}, the amount of the entire settlement that was negotiated with XXXX, from the {$190.00}, the original fraudulent amount that XXXX had tried to collect from me. 

I am in a position where I do not know who to turn to about this. I monitor my credit health weekly. I have never missed a payment for anything. I have gone through all of the proper channels but XXXX continues to employ fraudulent behavior and not be held accountable.

If I was given correct information from their business credit card rep, I would have NEVER applied for their card when I have opened more than 5 new accounts within the past two years.

On XX/XX/18, a Home Depot Salesperson, XXXX XXXX, signed us up for two home improvement projects ( new rain gutters and a new sliding-glass door/window ). He never provided us receipts for these services nor has Home Depot or their installers, so we have no way of comparing prices to what we see on our Home Depot credit card statement.

2. Also onXX/XX/18 Mr. XXXX called up Home Depot 's Consumer Credit telephone line and signed us up for a Home Depot credit card promising us a 2-year interest-free promotion. He initialed our Consumer Credit Application "" XXXX XX/XX/18 '' and the telephone representative confirmed the 2-year interest-free promotion on these home improvement projects, repeating various times that our call was being recorded for "" quality assurance. '' 3. It took many weary, frustrating months to get Home Depot to schedule the installations of these projects, but they were finally complete just before XXXX  in mid-XX/XX/XXXX ( over 3 months after Mr. XXXX 's sales visit ). Again, we never received receipts or invoices for these repair projects, so we simply have to "" trust '' that our bill is correct. However, the initial bills did NOT honor the promotional 2-years interest-free rate promised us by the salesperson Mr. XXXX, by the telephone consumer credit representative at the time we signed the agreements and application, and even by the Home Depot scheduler over the months it took to get the projects installed.

4. I wrote several complaints about the billing statements not honoring the 2-year interest-free promotional rate without resolution. It appeared a robot was responding to my complaints. I finally had to call the so-called "" Consumer Care '' line during "" business hours '' ( difficult for a full-time working mom/XXXX  ) to resolve the issue, as my bill said it would start accruing interest as ofXX/XX/XXXX ( i.e., 6 months interest-free, not the 24 months that I was quoted at the time of sale and application as well as repeated in calls with the Home Depot scheduler ).

5. Today,XX/XX/XXXX, I sat down to pay my bill that is due in XX/XX/XXXX, and I see that I have acquired a surprise interest charge of {$2.00}. No, it's not a lot, but it is a sneaky fee that makes me again doubt the business practices of this company that has offered my 24-months interest free. I further noticed that this is the first billing statement that warns me of a "" revolving balance '' that can accrue interest. However, this information is buried on page 3 near the end of the statement, i.e., buried beneath all of this information : Summary, Payment Information, Promotional Balances, Advertisements for gift cards, Billing Coupon, Information About Your Account, Key Credit Terms, Change of Address Form, Another Advertisement for Nest, etc.

6. I have never seen a more confusing billing statement, and I have several credit cards and am vigilant about my credit, my debt, and my bills. For example, I have an XXXX XXXX Citi Master Card, a XXXX XXXX American Express Card, and a XXXX XXXX XXXX Visa Card. None of these billing statements from other companies have deceived me. I am confident in accusing Home Depot 's consumer credit card with deceptive business practices. In addition to not honoring quoted promotions, the billing statement buries fees and is difficult to read. It frequently has mistakes and it does not explain what the date or nature of each purchase. Instead of clearly marking a date and citing the transaction with something like HVAC service or window installation, window materials, or window down payment, etc. ; the bill simply lists as follows : "" Revolving Balance NO INT FOR 24MOS-PMT REQ NO INT FOR 24MOS-PMT REQ NO INT FOR 24MOS-PMT REQ NO INT FOR 24MOS-PMT REQ. '' 7. To make matters worse, Home Depot and their service providers have provided no receipts for these services, so I have no way of comparing my billing statement to my receipts or invoices. In other words, I am at the mercy of Home Depot 's supposed honor system here, when I have already discovered various mistakes and problems with my bill.

8. It blows my mind that this company has such deceptive and incompetent business practices, and I would NEVER recommend this card to anyone else. I am tempted to just pay it off in full before the 24-month promotion ends in order to not accrue any more headaches with this company, but I do have other home improvement projects that I need to spend my available funds on.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NC,288XX,,Consent provided,Web,02/24/2019,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3161202
