Recd alert from XXXX XXXX of credit filing of delinquency ; contacted Rushmore. They said they never received payment ; I gave them all the information of the receipt of submitting. I've called numerous times and they kept saying they never received. Gave them the tracking # I had. 
There is no one else I can speak with ; there is no email address that can be used to communicate and deliver documentation. Either fax or regular mail. No attempt on their part to track receipt of said money using the information provided. 
rec 'd another statement dated XX/XX/XXXX indicating owing {$0.00}. Again I called and resubmitted the information regarding payment information ; they replied they had no way to track it, as they never received. Another notification of now the delinquency of over 60 days. 
XX/XX/XXXX - another call to Rushmore asking for assistance of tracking my payment and resolving the credit reporting. Still no assistance in helping. Therefore, I went to my bank and REWIRED ANOTHER PAYMENT. 
XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX CST resent ANOTHER wire transfer with an additional cost to me of {$25.00} -- Also, contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they have record from XXXX , Rushmore Loan Management Services received funds XX/XX/XXXX. Trace # is XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX - again called Rushmore to give them information that I just wired ANOTHER PAYMENT and was told to call back on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX to verify they received. 
XX/XX/XXXX - called and they verified payment received and closed account. I asked about next step in resolving credit reporting and also let them know they now have received TWO payments from me. Gave them additional information again for THEIR bank with a tracking # XXXX. Their records indicate a follow up is needed by me next Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

Asked them to report to credit agencies their reporting that the account was not delinquent which affected my CREDIT SCORE greatly. They indicated they would send to consumer affairs department for investigation however it is still under investigation. They offer no customer service to assist in rectifying the situation other than the customer doing all the calling ; following up. I was told to call XX/XX/XXXX, or I can mail/fax communication and wait again for reply. There is no other communication other than the one customer service line and you are unable to speak with anyone else ; no supervisor or anyone other than the rep on the phone. 

This loan was first taken from XXXX XXXX XXXX  and the account was turned over in XX/XX/XXXX to Rushmore Loan. In six years paying the mortgage for a payoff amount of {$0.00} this company has ruined my credit and is making no attempts to assist in correcting the problem. 

As of today XX/XX/XXXX, Rushmore has now an additional {$73.00} due to the double payment in which they can not tell me how or when the payment will be reissued back to me. Again, no one to speak with at all to assist in resolving issue. 

I have made every attempt possible to rectify the situation with no assistance whatsoever from Rushmore other than being treated like an individual who is trying NOT to pay a {$0.00} debt when I clearly paid a {$15000.00} debt I owed timely.

03/14/2019,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"The reason I am writing to you is to state that Upstart is being inconsiderate, I have always been a loyal if not outstanding customer. Ive always considered it a priority to make all my payments on time. Unfortunately, I fell short of my own standards earlier this year, and I was over a month late in XX/XX/2018 ( payment reported as 30-59 days late ). Also, I had been carrying a sizable balance for several months but as I am writing to you now, I am in the process of paying of the balances on my Upstart account. their records will show that I had never been late with a payment until this unfortunate oversight. 

The reason for me to be off the schedule to make the payments is that I got married in XX/XX/2018 ( Proof of Marriage ). As a result, I travelled out for my honeymoon for a few days, having expected to be back in time to take care of my payments. Unfortunately, During the few days honeymoon, my wife fell very Ill and could not come back as planned. I wish all was well in our Honeymoon and had come back in time but now its too late for me to go back in time and fix the situation. This was not entirely my fault as I was not around to make payment. Were it not for this set back, I could have maintained my perfect record. I can assure you it wont happen again going forward. 

The reason for writing this letter is that Im planning to apply for a mortgage loan, and its come to my attention that the missed payment on my record could hurt my ability to qualify. I truly believe that it doesnt reflect my creditworthiness and commitment to repaying my debts. 

As a long-time customer in good standing, it would help me immensely if you could give me a second chance and make a goodwill adjustment to remove the late payment from my file that was reported in XX/XX/2018.

03/13/2019,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX I received a two notices in the mail from BBVA Compass bank about two transactions of "" Failed Scheduled Transactions ''. The notices are dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. This triggered me to contact BBVA to find out about these transactions. These transactions turned out to be fraudulent. the information I was able to gathered turned out to be the tip of the iceberg. I was advised several ATM and Wire transactions totaling $ XXXXhad been completed over 30 transactions from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

The next day my wife and I arrived at the local BBVA branch to make a claim for the unauthorized wire and ATM transactions. At that time the local banker advised the profile on my account had been changed. My contact telephone number had been changed, on-line banking was added to may account ( note : I had cancelled the on-line account when my parents passed away. The BBVA records will support there has not been an on-line account since XX/XX/XXXX ). In addition, PIN numbers had been changed/updated or added without my knowledge or consent. I have only one ATM card. 

It became clear during my visit to the local branch someone had impersonanted my wife and the changes were complete. 

Based these facts I believe XXXX has a serious breach in there security and the responsibility of securing my funds or to vet any person who attempts to make the changes described above without the person "" personally '' going to the bank. 

Let me repeat. Any changes made by BBVA was irresponsible, was not properly vetted and without my consent. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the personal bank assisted to report all Unauthorized phone transactions ( ATM and Wire ) we completed all necessary forms ( so I thought ) and Case Numbers for both the Wire and ATM Dispute claims were completed. I was advised I would need to return to the back to complete and notarize Affidavits for the Wire transfers. This was completed on XX/XX/XXXX. The affidavits were emailed to the fraud department before I left the bank on the 7th. 

This is were the nightmare begins. Since that day BBVA personnel had never been upfront and honest when asked the question ... '' can you advise how, when and what occurred on or about XX/XX/XXXX when a person who claimed to be my spouse either called in to make the changes above. '' No response. I requested copies of any telephone recording on the day in question involving my account. No reply. Denied. 

The second question ... "" can you advise what your investigation will entail and when will it be completed. '' I have been provided a dozen different responses to this question. 

I have been lied to, had the phone hung up on me and been treated, not as a customer, or a victim, but as the accused. 

I have asked, if you are satisfied I am a victim, then why has my money not been returned to me and you seek your funds from the bank receiving the wire transfer ( XXXX XXXX  ) or from the entities who received funds from ATM transactions. The replies come from inexperienced personnel in The Who read from scripts and have to reach outside to "" back offices '' for updates. Not once has a XXXX investigator contacted me to advise on XXXX part of their progress. 

I submitted a written complaint on XX/XX/XXXX to the president of the BBVA XXXX XXXX. I have never received a call or written acknowledgement from anyone! Also, we hand delivered a copy of this home office complaint to the local BBVA Branch in XXXX, CA. 

But it gets better. After two weeks on constant calling on my part. I was advised Provisional deposits would be made on XX/XX/XXXX for the unauthorized ATM withdrawals. Form letters dated XX/XX/XXXX were finally received indicating credits for each transaction was provided. The form letter requested a return of a Written Statement of Unauthorized Debit. The form did not include when the form should be returned. When I contacted BBVA on XX/XX/XXXX to question the amounts noted on the cover letter I was advised I needed to return the form by XX/XX/XXXX or the Provisional deposits added to my account would be removed. Again NO ONE advised when I met with the personal banker on XX/XX/XXXX or on any of the numerous calls that this form needed to be completed and why then if the form was needed would my account be created without first returning a form BBVA Compass so desperately needed? 

Well I had to create a separate Word document with the dates of all the transactions and amounts, because the form letter did not provide enough space to list all of the transactions. The word document, a copy of the XX/XX/XXXX form letter and its attachments were mailed on XX/XX/XXXX in the self-addressed envelope provided by BBVA. I wanted to scan and email the information, but when I contacted the number on the form letter, BBVA was closed on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX and I need to call during normal business hours XXXX XXXX. 

Thinking I had completed with everything BBVA required, I was shocked to received another form letter dated XX/XX/XXXX denying my claim and to advise ALL of the Unauthoized ATM I had claimed transactions were now considered Authorized based on their investigation and all provisional deposits would be removed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called the dispute department the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to the representative and a supervisor and was told the Written Statement of Unauthorized Debit had not been received and I would have to start new new dispute and a new claim!!!!! BBVA would not open the same claim. In fact, and this is odd since BBVA is not open on Saturday the claim was closed on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX. 

As far os the Wire transfer claim I have heard nothing and I am insulted by the attitude of BBVA the lack of empathy for an innocent customer and a victim of fraud. 

I am pleading with anyone who will this. I need help.

03/13/2019,Debt collection,I do not know,False statements or representation,"Impersonated attorney, law enforcement, or government official","This complaint is about the business practices of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX XXXX, California and its staff who lie repeatedly and appear to be running a total scam. Trying to collect debts and demanding you pay them or they will threaten to sue you, put a lien on your house, they admitted to calling relatives we don't speak to -- -even though they had our number and we have lived in the same place for 8 years. They lie when they call and refuse to identify themselves, they demand your full name and SSN and Birthdate and when you don't give it they begin threatening you repeatedly. If you tell them you don't know what the debt is, they claim you are a liar and you are not allowed to get a word in to the point you have to hang up. If you write them ANY letters, they will claim not to have received them. 

When this company began contacting me they could provide me with XXXX  answers. They act like you are their slave and that they are the only people entitled to any information. They failed to provide me with very basic information like the original account number and name of the company claiming I owed the money. They refused to do any of this, they also have an incorrect last name, this is not the name I use, I will not give these people my SSN and they had the incorrect Birth date, and then changed the birth date to match the correct one illegally. 

I am not paying this debt since I had to do all the work myself -- -I have never had any credit with the business they are claiming which turned out to be some XXXX XXXX I have not been to since XXXX. When I had gone to this place I used an ATM card not credit to pay for my pet to get fixed and that does not cost anywhere near the amount these people are claiming. Also in order to get your pet back, you have to pay the bill and since I still have my pet its obvious I did. I moved not long after I last visited this place, and have since that time used a totally different clinic since XXXX. I have no line of credit at any of these places. 

My husband works for the feds and the constant attacks on XXXX caused our information to be stolen and used by unknown persons locally and not locally numerous times and we retain the statements from XXXX telling us we are victims. They too have recently conducted their investigation and ruled in our favor with regards to this debt. These people can provide me with NO information despite the multiples of times I have asked for it -- -all they send is a piece of paper that has an amount due and threatening comments about suing me, they have also sent me fake court documents and I took these to the court house and they stated they were FAKE. That's not legal, they also call and leave messages calling themselves "" investigators '' that's incorrect as they are debt collectors. Its also not legal to state they are investigators. A few called claiming to be attorneys and told me they could garnish my wages. They send letters demanding you respond 7 days from the date on the headers, and then make sure to mail the letters the day before the last day of response, this way when you receive it -- -its already expired for response. 

The BBB gives these people a "" C '' rating and I can see why. I took a trip to find out where this place was, but it appeared to be operating out of some elderly people 's hospital which didn't make any sense. 

They have called my house and when my daughter or sister answered the phone the man or woman on the other end called them "" XXXX '' and claimed they were me. Calling these people or making any contact at all with them is a lost cause. They have NO information to share with me other than a supposed amount I know with no account number attached to it. Its not the first time some creditor has done this and I am sure it wont be the last since our information as govt workers is never secure. These people did not even begin contacting us until mid XXXX and claimed they had been trying to collect since XXXX ... the last phone call I received was a threatening call about how she was going to see me in court in XXXX, well past the statute of limitations for collection. I have asked for their business License and have gotten no response, I have searched for the names listed in the fake documents only to find said people use false or fake not full names. 

They are constantly playing games. Its getting very old and its obvious they are trying very hard to collect a debt they can not prove I own. No signature card, no correct Birthdate, no SSN, refused to give me the name of the original creditor, I actually had to find this information myself. I called the vet clinic and also went in and they had no record of any such debt from any time period. However, they also claimed they had no control over the bank they used to offer credit to people. They would not give me the name of that bank either. 

Their fake threatening court docs were signed on XX/XX/XXXX and claimed you had 7 days to respond ... the item arrived in the mail box XX/XX/XXXX way passed the 7 days dead line- this is also bad business practice and its the second time they've sent the same letter and did the same exact thing making sure you can not respond to them. It also still does not state the account number for this line of credit, it does not give a start date or an end date for it, and they added all kinds of other false charges to the debt. 

They contacted my husbands mother, a woman he does not have contact with. She is an XXXX and XXXX XXXX, these people shared my information with her, and she called my home and told me about it. My husband is not listed on this debt, so why was his mother who lives in another state contacted? I had not spoken to this woman in 15 years and have no intention of doing so ever again because of some company like this. I do not owe this debt, the very business claiming I owe it stated they had no record of said debt. I was also told by the XXXX XXXX that this debt is passed the statute of limitation for collections according to the dates they give, which change as time goes by. At no time did I ever take responsibility for this debt, nor did I ever state I would make any payments to them, they are so rude over the phone to my family members who live in my house that I will no longer speak to them at all.

03/12/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"In XX/XX/2019, I paid off my remaining mortgage balance of {$220000.00} through four {$50000.00} payments initiated through a customer service representative at Freedom Mortgage and a {$24000.00} wire transfer that Freedom Mortgage instructed I submit per the payoff statement they provided me. I went to my bank after receiving a payoff statement from Freedom Mortgage and sent a final wire transfer payment of {$24000.00} on XX/XX/2019. I was able to confirm everything was received through reviewing my account on-line with a Freedom Mortgage representative to confirm that everything was applied to my principal. Additionally, the representative confirmed on XX/XX/2019 that my account was closed out and my automatic monthly payment removed, as nothing else was owed. I took screen shots of the payments applied, as illustrated on their website. Then I received a letter dated XX/XX/2019 that indicated my pay-off was complete, my mortgage release documents were being processed and will be mailed to the County Clerk and that I should notify my insurance company and county tax authority to begin mailing statements directly to me. Additionally, I received a check dated XX/XX/2019 for my escrow ( taxes and insurance ). Then I arrived home from business & personnel travel on XX/XX/2019 and opened a new statement from Freedom Mortgage indicating I had a balance of {$51000.00}. I called Freedom Mortgage immediately the next day to try to understand what had happened. They indicated that my bank retracted a {$50000.00} payment on XX/XX/2019, and they re-instated my Loan account. They also added accrued interest and late payment charges. This story seemed far-fetched given my finance background, so I went online to review my XXXX bank statement only to notice that 3 {$50000.00} payments were pulled from Freedom Mortgage rather than the 4 I had authorized. As a result, I called Freedom Mortgage to tell them that something happened on their end since it showed they had collected all 4 payments but they had not pulled the last one from my bank. Then I set up a conference call with the customer service representative from Freedom Mortgage, my bank and I, as Freedom Mortgage continued to blame me and my bank for the mishap. Freedom Mortgage continued to tell me that I owed the accrued interest and remaining balance due. My bank told them that no fourth withdrawl of {$50000.00} was initiated by Freedom Mortgage, so Freedom Mortgage decided they would review the recorded authorizations they had on file with me & their service rep ( on XX/XX/2019 ). After reviewing the recording, they FINALLY agreed it was their fault and they will reverse the accrued interest. I told them I agreed that I owed {$50000.00} but no more ( no interest ) and they can pay my second wire transfer payment and any other fees to perform a 'second ' payoff. I requested a formal letter and payoff indicating that the only remaining amount I owe is {$50000.00} with no accrued interest or other fees, including that they will reimburse me for the second {$30.00} wire transfer I now have to pay my bank. Since this discussion on Thursday, XX/XX/2019, the payoff nor a letter has been sent to me to rectify the situation. I also had to place a stop payment with my bank to not pay the mortgage payment set to withdraw on XX/XX/2019, as I found out Freedom Mortgage illegally set up an automatic withdrawl from my bank after they re-instated my account on XX/XX/2019 without even contacting me to tell me they were re-instating it. I have been fully willing to wire the {$50000.00} as a final payoff but want a formal document from them stating it is my final payoff. Supposedly they are still 'working on it ' to resolve this issue ( since XX/XX/XXXX once they finally believed me ), but now I'm worried that I appear in 'default ' on my loan since I put a stop payment to Freedom Mortgage with my bank and worried my credit score will be in jeopardy, when ironically I was the one paying off my mortgage in full. Each day I talk with them, they ask for another day and they have not let me speak to anyone further than a supervisor when I ask to elevate the issue.

This other gentleman begins to explain how he can not allow us to make a down payment on the agreed upon price of the vehicle because, "" we wouldn't make enough money on the deal. '' I argued and pushed back because I was told the manager had approved the deal knowing my intent to put money down. In the end, I agreed to purchase the vehicle anyway, because I wanted/needed it. 

We eventually made our way back to the finance manager, XXXX to close our loan. I told XXXX what happened and he shrugged it off like it was no big deal and even said, "" Oh yea we have a new sales manager out there who came from a dealership in Florida. He won't let anyone with good credit make a down payment. '' The next week or so ... 
I called Nissan USA Consumer Affairs to make them aware and they created a ticket so that someone could follow up with me. A man named XXXX called me and explained that since the dealership is privately owned they couldn't really do anything about it, but that he would send it to the dealership directly so they could contact me.

03/12/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"We had a forbearance period on our mortgage loan due to superstorm Sandy. Ditech has now sent us a letter of default due to us being in that program. 

Our account now shows {$32000.00} in arrears which is impossible. At {$1400.00} per month in interest the total if any would be {$17000.00}. But we are not supposed to be in arrears due to our participation in the Sandy forbearance program. 

During the 1 year period we payed our monthly escrows. Ditech is still stating that we are in arears with our mortgage and they haven't applied our mortgage payments correctly to our account. They have not been applying it to escrows and keep doing escrow advances to cover insurance, MI, and tax payments. I found out this was the reason that we received a notice of cancellation for our homeowners insurance. Ditech was waiting for a managers approval to pay the premium as there was not sufficient funds in our escrow account due to their ( lack of ) accounting. 

Ditech has just transfered the servicing to another lender efeective XX/XX/XXXX which will make this even harder to solve with a company that knows little of what we have went through for the past few months. 

Attached is : 1. A letter from Ditech from XX/XX/XXXX requesting us to sign a mortgage modification for a loan term of 40 years where our address and information was changed to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, MO.

03/12/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"Starting in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX payment system ( XXXX ) started to reverse my auto mortgage monthly payments. I was charged late and returned check fees as a result. I contacted their Services group and was told the following : 1. "" The bank accounts I used did not have the correct account number ''. I told them the bank account I used had been set up since the beginning of the loan, about 5 yrs ago and there had never been any problems with money being transferred into Flagstar until now. 
2. "" The bank I used did not have sufficient funds ''. I forwarded my bank 's history record to show there were plenty of funds to pay when the transactions took place. 
3. "" My banks did not send them the money because of "" not authorized '' transactions ''. I had to forwarded my bank 's history ledgers to show my checking accounts had been debited which shows the money had been sent to Flagstar. 

Due to advice from # 1, I changed my bank on XXXX to 2 other banks to continue paying the monthly mortgage. Both had the same issue. So 3 of my banks had same issues. Flagstar kept reversing my payments with the same above excuses. I told them it was my banks it was their system. 
When Flagstar reversed the payments, the funds that my banks sent to them were never returned. My banks says they had sent the money to Flagstar but never received any notifications the money is being returned. In order to credit back the money my banks had to initiate their own investigation and perform a Dispute before my money could be credited back into my account. 

I talked to about 10 services reps and 2 Supervisors. None can help explain why Flagstar keeps reversing the payments. Each time this happens I get charged a Returned check fee. Because no one at Flagstar can resolve the issues and my money was taken from the checking accounts to pay Flagstar but was not returned when they performed a Returned check I decided to payoff my loan. I don't trust Flagstar to manage my loan anymore. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I follow the payoff procedures and obtained the Payoff value from Flagstar. With the payoff, Flagstar confirmed my loan was paid in full and the Deed of XXXX was sent to me with an Escrow refund. When I cashed the Escrow refund check, Flagstar had put a stopped payment on the refund check and told me I still owe them money. If I don't pay then they will rescind the release of the mortgage/trust. 

Because of the many reversed payments performed by Flagstar I feel they still have not returned all my money and that they still owe me money. I can not get anyone from Flagstar to work with me on the accounting for the money. They keep passing me to other people and each time it gets more confusing and more paperwork is required.

03/12/2019,Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"Background : My identity was unknowingly stolen by a previous roommate who lived in the same household sometime around XXXX. 

It just came to my attention that on XX/XX/XXXX the individual set up a 5 year contract with XXXX for a home alarm account with both of our names as the account holders ( maybe for co-sign purposes? ). This location of the residence where this alarm account was opened is on the opposite side of the country. 

The individual made payments for 1 year and 8 months before the account went delinquent. The account then went to collections a little while later, and landed in the hands of the debt collector named Perfection Collection around XX/XX/XXXX. 

When I was contacted by the debt collector, I let them know that I did not set up this account, nor have I ever lived in the state it was setup in, nor on that side of the United States. I let them know that the individual 's name on the account was a previous roommate, and that he must've stolen my identity 15+ years ago. 

They responded to my deny of the account by saying they already talked to the other individual and he said that I stole his information to setup the account, and then implied that they are only looking for repayment, not looking to get me in trouble for setting up the account under his name ; which isn't even true in the first place. 

I continued to get harassing calls for payment. When I asked how to fix the problem, they did not provide any assistance ; their only interest was to get repayment for the account, and did not take into consideration that the account was fraudulently setup in my name. 

I had to make several calls to get info on how to take this off my credit report, because they were not helping. When I finally reached someone, they were hesitant to give me the information about the account, as well as hesitant about telling me steps I need to get it resolved. 

I filed a police report with my local police, and found more information on steps to take from IdentityTheft.gov on my own ; however, when I call them now they no longer answer the phone, nor do they return my voicemails.

I was told by my single point of contact, XXXX, that because of the Dispute Status and my documents being in review that he was going to place the sale date on hold and I requested it be postponed or cancelled due to the time restrictions. 

If I am denied a modification, I am requesting a breakdown of all information used to come to this conclusion, as I have a right as a homeowner to review and dispute any erroneous choices Shellpoint may have used to come to their conclusions. I say this from my past experience, since the last review Shellpoint conveniently added 3 properties I do not own, and did not take into consideration that I had properties in a Trial Plan that did not reflect yet on mortgage statements which they chose to use instead and ignore this fact. I have since sent in new, updated financials to which I more than qualify for a modification therefore, if denied again, I am requesting the details of how Shellpoint came to their conclusion, as I believe they are stringing me along, violating Dual-Tracking laws in order to keep me at bay until a few days before the XX/XX/XXXX sale date, steal my property and leave me with no recourse. I do not trust this kind of deception and unfair business practice and am protecting myself legally for a lawsuit should Shellpoint decide to continue this course of illegal action. My attorneys have filed a Lis Pendens purposely in response to their previous behavior and we are ready to move forward if need be. 
I am a single woman and a XXXX year old senior citizen trying to take care of myself financially and I feel Shellpoint and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is treating me unfairly, and are being deceptive in their activities and should be held accountable for their actions. How is it that I have qualified for 4 other modifications on my properties yet Shellpoint, through their erroneous review can not seem to give me a modification? Also, Shellpoint mentioned that they sent me a modification in the mail in the past? If so, I have never received it! Obviously, my actions are in order to get a modification so why would I have ignored a modified, lower payment/principal/interest rate loan if provided to me? I am requesting that whatever modification Shellpoint is speaking of that they offered me be sent to me, as I have never received it. Obviously, since Shellpoint is stating they offered me a modification in the past I must have qualified, so I am requesting that this be mailed to me in order to accept it.

I explained that there was a residence on the credit report that I've never lived at and the Customer Service representative told me that because I had mail forwarded to the residence that I couldn't remove it. That makes no sense to me because technically I haven't lived with the Owner of the home for 10 years in a previous residence. At the end of the day, when I account for the situation the owner of that home eventually stopped sending and therefore I stopped receiving my mail. I moved into an employment program because of possible government involvement that constituted entrapment charges that I wasn't seeing served. After even more accounting into past events that would constitute possible other felony charges that are not being paid any attention at the current time although they've been communicated to federal law enforcement. That could be collusion but I have an international limitation situation that suggests foul play from a military branch so its a federal case and the owner of the home seems to be getting a pass. In response, I've made distance between myself and my parents. My mother 's address was removed and the owner of the other residence is my father. I do not wish to be held liable for the property because of my wish to pursue legal action for my own assets which seem to be caught up in whatever is going on with my information.

03/11/2019,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"I've had a credit card with Citicards for 15 years and have always made payments on time. 

Recently, I linked my account to another bank account that I ended up having issues with, and a few payments were returned. I always made a payment when I was alerted to this, and the payments were never more than a few days late. 

In XXXX, they called me to tell me a payment had been returned, and I immediately paid two months worth of payments due. I was told my next payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX. I found out my card was then placed on a 30 day hold due to the returned payments - fine. I spoke to several people on the phone and no one told me it would be an issue in the future. 

Since I didn't have a payment due until XX/XX/XXXX, I didn't think anything of it. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, they attempted to take a payment from my account through AutoPay ( my experience had been that if your minimum payment was {$0.00}, they wouldn't try to get a payment on the due date ). I called Citi and was told that they did always try to take more payments anyway, but that because of the misunderstanding, they'd refund my {$37.00} fee. I also asked if this would mean another 30 day hold and the customer service rep told me no, my account was fine, and I was welcome to use the card as normal. 

So I was very surprised when a few weeks later, I logged onto my account to find out it had been closed, due to "" poor account performance '' aka the returned payments. If I had been warned at any time that my account was at risk, or had gotten TRUE information from the customer service reps, or they had even MENTIONED that a payment would be taken out even when one was made, I would have immediately paid off the whole account so as not to risk my credit score.
